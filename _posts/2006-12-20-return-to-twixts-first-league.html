<p>I'm really happy to have finished second in <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=twixt.ch.13.2.1">twixt.ch.13.2.1</a> (I explained it many times but here it goes once again: 13th championship, 2nd league, division 1 (that doesn't really matter)). It guarantees me participation in league 1 during 14th champ. A few words concerning the games:</p>
<p>The <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=605434">game against Loren</a> was a disaster. I am not sure what where went wrong, but the only move that seems weird is 6th move. After Loren's 7th move it already looked very weird and after move 9 it was game over. So much for any chances for the first place.</p>
<p>My <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=605441">game against passenger</a>, who will probably finish third, didn't look very promising for me, as I mentioned in a <a  href="http://blog.tasuki.org/2006/12/09/2000-in-twixt/">previous post</a>. It was after my move 11, his move 12 was a surprising and devastating mistake. Playing I13 instead, forcing my I12, would lead to a winning game for him. Of course, after J5, I13 no longer needs to be answered locally. Omitting this exchange practically gains white a very important move for connecting the right side string to the lower area. Fast forward to 22, that's a pretty much forced exchange. I am not sure if my 23 is good, but I felt it would be enough. 24 should imho be played at K18 (kosumi, for those of you who know go  ;)). After that I can't play H17 (because of L16), so I'm forced to follow I16, I19, E18 (I'll leave the subsequent variations for the kind reader to explore  :licknose:). After 24 it's quite easy already, but overall I was pretty lucky that passenger missed 12.i13.</p>
<p>My <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=605449">game against maraca</a> was surprisingly easy. I got a good start (which is unusual for me) and managed to follow through. He's not in his top form I guess, because otherwise he's a very tough competitor.</p>
<p>The <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=605453">game against Robin</a> was a disaster because of my move 5 (I mistook the sides and was trying to connect horizontally instead of vertically). This mistake is almost equal to omitting a move and it's usually game over. But you haven't seen ferocious tasuki yet!  :cursing: I started playing left and right and making the game into as much mess as possible. Robin was scared: having a won game of someone who has almost 2000 when you have 1750 is quite difficult on nerves. I managed to get a very good position, but then he played move 24 which confused me to a point where I missed ultra-simple F14 (sometimes it makes one wonder what else is possible to miss). Connection on the right side wasn't difficult though, so I connected there. Phew.</p>
<p>Another not so great beginning was the game <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=605450">against Syl</a>, but his move 19 is completely without sense. After that it was pretty much over (and he was very polite and resigned quite soon).</p>
<p>The game <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=605448">against pete</a> was fast, I don't really understand it but managed to win easily. ;-)</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=605452">Michael Engels</a> managed to scare me, but he missed my move 14 (took me a while to find it too, after seeing his move 9 I almost got a heart attack, it scared me quite a lot).</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=605451">Petr Trojek</a> didn't put up much of a fight now, although last time he kicked my ass in a very <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=463124">interesting and unusual game</a>.</p>
<p>Finally I made much more complex analysis than I'd planned, it's yet another "blog post gone wild". If you read this far you certainly deserve congratulations for patience.</p>
