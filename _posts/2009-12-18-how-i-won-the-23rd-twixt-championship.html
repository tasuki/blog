<p>Who is this post for? Who is going to read it? Who is going to enjoy it? Anyways...</p>
<h3>First, a bit of history...</h3>
<p>I learned to play TwixT in 2004. You can have a look at my <a href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/info/player_chart.jsp?gtid=twixt&plid=5460">rating graph</a>. As you can see, after the initial jump, my progress was slow -- TwixT never was the main thing in my life.</p>
<p>There are three types of tournaments on littlegolem: rated tournaments, monthly cups, and championship league. The league is by far the most prestigious. You can <a href="http://www.edcollins.com/golem/#Could%20you%20explain%20the%20different%20types%20of%20tournaments%20available?">read more about littlegolem tournaments</a>.</p>
<p>My first championship was third division of the third league -- <a href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=twixt.ch.4.3.3">twixt.ch.4.3.3</a>, the games look a little funny now. In the next championship I won 5.2.2 with one loss and proceeded to the first league. I finished fifth in <a href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=twixt.ch.6.1.1">6.1.1</a>, scoring 4 wins out of 8 games.</p>
<p>I had similar results in 7th and 8th championships, in <a href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=twixt.ch.9.1.1">9.1.1</a> I even finished fourth. 10.1.1 was the first appearance of the amazing polish brothers, who finished second and third, but it was a small disaster for me -- I only won two games and got demoted to second league. After that I continued jumping up and down between first and second league: 10.1.1 down, 11.2.2 up, 12.1.1 down (though I <a href="http://twixt.servegame.org/game/535056">won against Klaus in a very short game</a>), 13.2.1 up, 14.1.1 down, 15.2.2 up.</p>
<p>I got lucky I didn't get demoted in 16.1.1 ... 17.1.1 and 18.1.1 fifth places again. In 18th I had a <a href="http://twixt.servegame.org/game/876196">very interesting game against Axel</a>. I had a bad start, but managed to exploit his weaknesses to create a draw -- but I blundered at 44 and let him connect with 45. In 19.1.1 I had my usual fifth place, but 20.1.1 saw me underperform and fall to 21.2.1. As a warm up, I finished fourth in 22.1.1.</p>
<h3>History over, back to the present</h3>
<p>The start of 23.1.1 looked like I'd finish in my usual fifth place. I lost against David pretty quickly, and I had a surprisingly easy game against Steven. Meanwhile, I was losing three other games -- against spd_iv, Klaus and crclum. <a href="http://twixt.servegame.org/game/1107594">Against Klaus</a>, I had a bad game from the start, but Klaus blundered with 39.t19 (s20 or u19 would have done the trick), giving me an undeserved victory.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://twixt.servegame.org/game/1107581">game against spd_iv</a> wasn't that bad in the beginning, but then something went wrong, though I'm not sure what. I think spd_iv could have just played 21.h7 for an easier win. But actually, his variation would have led to a win too, if it wasn't for his unnecessary 25.d7 which I responded with the <a href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=1107581&nmove=26">best TwixT move I've ever played</a>. I think that made me deserve the win.</p>
<p>I have no idea what happened in my game against crclum. I was losing from the very beginning, and it was just getting worse all the time, but I still have no idea why. In the end, he just <a href="http://twixt.servegame.org/game/1107606">resigned in a won position</a> (23.q7 24.r5 25.t5 26.v5 27.r4 28.t6 29.n6 leads to a win as does 23.q7 24.r5 25.v5 26.t5 27.t4 as does 23.r6 24.q4 25.p7 (spd_iv pointed out the last variation)). So, I was extremely lucky.</p>
<h3>On early resigning</h3>
<p>As for crclum's resignation, I didn't have the guts to ask him about it or point out that he could've won. While I admire early resigning and often myself try to resign lost games as soon as possible (it's <em>good manners</em> and it shows <em>confidence in one's judgement</em>), it's better not to overdo it and resign won games!</p>
