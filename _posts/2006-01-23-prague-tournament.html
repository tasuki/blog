<p>During the weekend I was in Prague playing go tournament (won by a Korean guy without a single loss). In the end I finished 8th with 2 wins and 3 loses, nothing great. I lost to Vladimir Danek by half a point, that kind of sucks (especially considering that I have never beaten him before (he is the only Czech player I haven't beaten yet (ok, I was very lucky against Ondrej Silt once (btw do you like nested brackets? (I just love them))), but I hope to win him someday)).</p>
<p>On saturday evening we have been ice-skating, which is much more fun than I thought it would be, I really enjoyed it (and fell only twice ;)).</p>
