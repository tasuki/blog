    got here :)\r\n\r\nAnd I didn't say that chess was easy. The game tree sure is
    deep, but chess is not a beautiful game."

  content: Strong Go players are a bit like spoilt brats. Just because Go is more
    elegant then chess, does NOT make chess inelegant. And just because Go is more
    complex and/or profound, similarly does NOT make chess either trivial or prosaic.
    Personally, while I love Go, I really enjoy the more tactile creativity you get
    from playing a game like Chinese Chess (my favourite). Shoot me down if you must,
    but as elegant as I find Go I also find it very dry to play!

  content: "While go includes a lot of \"around here first, and then around there\"
    kind of thinking, one's strength is mostly dependent on reading (ie. counting
    the moves ahead in your head precisely). If you can solve life&death better than
    your opponent, you will usually win.\r\n\r\nAnd the thing I dislike most about
    chess are its complicated rules - I think that they make the game inelegant. Wikipedia's
    definition of elegance: \"Elegance is the attribute of being unusually effective
    and simple.\""

<p>Call me biased.</p>
<p>As much as I love cheese, I hate chess.</p>
<p>Chess is often regarded as "the best board game". Some say that chess is profound, that it requires more skill to master than other board games, and chess players often act arrogantly (take that, bastards, I can be arrogant too).</p>
<p>What I dislike the most about chess are the completely stupid and artificial rules, where each piece moves differently. It's a huge mess, not elegant a single bit. Chess players say it adds depth to the game. I say bullshit. If depth means a lot of variations, then go has way more variations then chess.</p>
<p>Strategy (long term planning) is almost nonexistant in chess, it's all down to how far you can read (<em>Chess is 99 percent tactics.</em> --Teichmann).</p>
<p>Ok, now I'm done with chess, let's look at some more interesting games:</p>
<p>Go has the most possibilities, but I also find it to be the most beautiful game (<em>Go uses the most elemental materials and concepts - line and circle, wood and stone, black and white - combining them with simple rules to generate subtle strategies and complex tactics that stagger the imagination.</em> --Iwamoto Kaoru). Nuff said.</p>
<p>TwixT and Hex are connecting games. The two players try to connect their sides - one vertically and the other one horizontally (which creates the conflict). Both these games have simple enough rules for a small child to learn yet the tactics and strategy are fairly deep. I am not so sure about Hex, but TwixT is a largely unexplored game. The level of TwixT play on littlegolem (where the world top players play, as it's almost the only place to play TwixT) has risen quite dramatically during the last two years.</p>
<p>And then there are many other games with simple rules yet profound strategy, and I think that they all deserve way more attention than the omnipresent chess, which suffers from being inelegant with its too complicated rules and which is based solely on one's reading and involves almost no strategy or long term planning at all.</p>
<p>Yes, I know that this post is not going to convert any chess players, but hell it made me feel better. B-)</p>
