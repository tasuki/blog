<p>This blog finally got hit by spammers. I recieve about 1 comment spam an hour, which is rather tough. Some get filtered automatically and I have to remove some of them by hand. Here I have to say <strong>big thanks</strong> to wordpress â€“ editing/removing comments is very easy and the interface is great (it also allows bulk deleting spam).</p>
<p>There are several possible solutions - first (and very obvious one) is me just removing all the spam comments by hand (or training a filter, which will not be very useful probably, as the comments vary a lot). Then there is an option in wordpress - comment author must have previously approved comment (well, I have to check this too, but the other comments will wait in the queue and will do no harm to the reader; otoh new authors will have to wait for their comments to appear, which is a bit of a nuisance).</p>
<p>As a last note, I really don't know what the fuckers want to accomplish - my blog doesn't have any big traffic and there is nofollow on the comment links, so they are mostly useless. But the comment spamming is probably highly automated so I expect I'll never get rid of them (and probably I can expect only higher and higher volume). And I am getting about 50 email spams daily too, luckily gmail's spam filter totally rocks (I used to check spam folder as it is not 100% accurate but I don't check it much anymore).</p>
