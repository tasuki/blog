  content: I haven't heard <i>Over the hills and far away</i>, but I guess it's a
    cover-version of the famous Led Zep's song. So not their, in fact. (But well,
    they could do a good job there.)

<p>I only very recently discovered <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightwish">Nightwish</a> (their <a  href="http://www.nightwish.com/">official site</a> is also worth visiting). The trick is that they have a real singer - <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarja_Turunen">Tarja Turunen</a> (well, she's not their singer anymore, but the past albums are sung by her). I'm not going to just copy wikipedia here (go read it yourself) so I'll add my subjective opinions about the albums:</p>
<ul>
<li>Angels Fall First - their first album, I really like it, the best songs are Elvenpath, Beauty and the Beast, Astral Romance, Angels Fall First, Eramaajarvi</li>
<li>Oceanborn - most the songs are a bit too fast but good nevertheless, particularly good are Gethsemane and Moondance (czesc kotasz); Sleeping Sun is one of the best Nightwish songs that can be found on new releases of this album or as a single</li>
<li>Wishmaster - nothing except the Wishmaster caught my attention on this album</li>
<li>Over the Hills And Far Away - only few songs, the good ones are Over the Hills And Far Away and the cover version of  Astral Romance</li>
<li>Century Child - there are some good songs: End of All Hope, The Phantom of the Opera, Beauty of the Beast; and there is one excellent song: Feel For You (I can listen to this one on repeat over and over again)</li>
<li>Once - this album was a complete hit and contains many great songs: Dark Chest of Wonders, Wish I had an Angel, Nemo, Planet Hell, Creek Mary's Blood, The Siren, Dead Gardens, Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan</li>
</ul>
<p>Now they are getting a new singer instead of Tarja... I don't want to say they can't find anyone this good, but at least it will be <em>very</em> difficult.</p>
