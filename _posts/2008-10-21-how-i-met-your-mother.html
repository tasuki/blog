I’ve never really watched any television series. Sure, I saw an episode or two of many various series, but it never quite felt worth spending more time on them. This summer I was shown 4 episodes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother">HIMYM</a>.

I tried to resist for a while, because I consider television series to be a waste of time (and time is the most precious for me). But after few weeks I just gave up and started watching the series from the start. And even though I “wasted” about 24 hours of my life, I don’t regret it.

Also, my opinion of Tuesdays has increased dramatically since I started watching HIMYM. Today’s episode (S04E05 as they say, or “Shelter Island”, if you prefer the full name) was simply perfect. There was a little bit of everything, silly jokes, profound jokes, back references, sad moments, life lessons, you name it.

Happy Tuesday!
