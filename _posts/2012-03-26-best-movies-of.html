<p>Orwen's blog post <a href="http://blog.orwen.org/2012/02/nejlepsi-filmy-z-jara-2012-ukazky/">best films of spring 2012</a> inspired me to write about movies as well. Actually, I've only started watching movies recently, and I haven't seen many so far. Most new movies move way too fast for me, so I prefer to watch the older ones.</p>
<p>The post mostly consists of just a list of movies. If you'd like to see reviews, click on the links. The IMDb reviews are usually far better than anything I could produce. Just watch out for spoilers.</p>
<p>Let's start with my current favorite directors:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000005/">Ingmar Bergman</a></h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060827/">Persona</a></strong> – The characters were hard to understand, the story unclear, the cinematography superb. All in all one of the best films I've seen, will have to watch once more.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050986/">Smultronstället</a></strong> (Wild Strawberries, but I wanna show off I can spell it out in Swedish) – A movie about life. Compared to Persona, Smultronstället was very easy to watch, though it did raise some interesting questions. I love movies with no antagonists.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050976/">The Seventh Seal</a></strong> – IMDb says: A man seeks answers about life, death, and the existence of God as he plays chess against the Grim Reaper during the Black Plague. That's pretty accurate. And I dig the rhyming squire.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001425/">Krzysztof Kieślowski</a></h3>
<p><strong>Trois Couleurs</strong> (Trzy Kolory, The Three Colours) – Inspired by the French flag and motto, they are <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108394/">Blue</a> (liberty), <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111507/">White</a> (equality), and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111495/">Red</a> (fraternity). I really liked White, though it's the least acclaimed one. Red was very cool too. Probably I wasn't in the right mood when watching Blue. And Jesus Christ, the IMDb trailers are so fucking terrible.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092337/">The Decalogue</a></strong> – ten short movies based on the ten commandments. Most are very good, the first and seventh are my favorites. I still haven't seen the last one due to Mac OS not being able to write on ext3.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101765/">La double vie de Véronique</a></strong> (The Double Life of Veronique) – more usually one person lives two lives but sometimes two people live one life. This movie is on my re-watch list (partially because I don't recall many of the details). Also, it might be easier to watch than any of the above – if you don't know where to start, start right here.</p>
<p>Stay tuned, next post is featuring Andrei Tarkovsky and Robert Bresson!</p>
