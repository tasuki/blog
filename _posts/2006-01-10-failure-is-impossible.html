During my math test I have been thinking about my life (that’s what I do during most of the tests). I was considering possible pluses and minuses of my recent web creating activity and found out that it can’t really end in a failure – the worst scenario being that I will “only” learn some xhtml, php, css, (mysql?), and also a lot about subjects of my sites, this isn’t really a wasted time, is it? And well, then there is always some slight chance of getting some money as well (the first week brought me about half a dollar, so if it continues at this pace I will be a millionaire in just about hundred thousand years…).

Oh yeah, and of course I screwed the math test…
