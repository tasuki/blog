<p>Wesnoth, Freeciv, Simutrans, Fillets, Tuxracer, Liquidwar, Angband/Nethack, Racer, Cube, Wolf ET... I thought there was nothing that could surprise me in  the word of linux gaming.</p>
<p>The other day I found <a  href="http://www.heptargon.de/gl-117/gl-117.html">GL-117</a>, a perfect action flight simulator. It's very easy to pilot the plane, there's a lot of action, and the best thing is that it all (usually) happens among hills (unlike most flight simulators where you fly high above the hills, which is no fun). In other words â€“ outstanding playability.</p>
<p>The only problem is that I got stuck in the campaign at mission called "tunnel". I seriously don't understand what they want me to do (when I fly through the tunnel, I crash into a red grid (first I thought it meant "this is the place you should get to", flying above results in about 5-7 planes attacking me, I am quite sure I can't take them down (too many & too strong)).</p>
<p>So go and install the bloody game so that you can help me with mission 20 :-)</p>
