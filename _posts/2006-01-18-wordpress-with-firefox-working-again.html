<p>This is weird, I decided to try it and now it works again.</p>
<p>I <strong>swear</strong> that I had deleted the cookies and cleared all the cache before, when it didn't work. I really do not understand where the problem was (but it was there, the body of the post would never load).</p>
<p>Well, nevermind, I am glad it works now and I hope it isn't going to stop :).</p>
