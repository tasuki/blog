    relatively new? Every alphabet is created by man at some point, and then undergoes
    mutations, like the Western one..

  content: "It's not only relatively new, but it was developed from scratch, by few
    bright guys, in a short period of time.\r\n\r\nLatin alphabet is derived from
    Greek, which is derived from Phoenician alphabet, which is derived from Hieroglyphs
    and some yet undeciphered bronze age alphabet (yes I stole that from Wikipedia
    8-)). That's a very evolutionary process which lasted thousands of years.\r\n\r\nObviously,
    alphabets are created by people, but I don't think that warrants calling all of
    them \"artificial\". It's similar with languages, they are also created by people.
    But would you say that Dutch is an artificial language? ;)"

  content: "Well, Tasuki, Glad to see you enjoyed Seoul.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working
    off the coast of Korea, and expect to spend several days in Seoul at the end of
    the job to do final reports (oh, joy!).\r\nI'd like to get at least one game in
    a Korean club - having been playing for over 20 years now, and having to organise
    my own club much of that time, the idea of going to have a game without having
    to organise a venue, boards, opponents, etc for myself  ... well the idea of just
    playing is appealing.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to contact Les Waller, who used to run
    the (Yongsan) Seoul Baduk Club ... but he seems to have disappeared off the 'Net
    ; I'm also contacting the IBA that you mention (their link came up as \"visited\"
    ). Any other suggestions.\r\nSo far, my experience of Seoul is getting through
    the city from Incheon airport to the railway station for onwards travel to Busan.
    I <em>think</em> that Les' club is at Yongsan, a few hundred metres from the main
    station ... which I'm confident of getting to, even if I can't find the exact
    place.\r\nAny hints?\r\n\r\n(please CC by mail ; I'm not able to stay on the net
    24x7)\r\nAidan"

  content: "Oh - \"complete lack of waste bins; I was told it’s because of the threat
    of terrorism (typical Korean overreaction)\"\r\n\r\nMuch of Britain had negligible
    waste bins in popular tourist areas while the IRA were carrying out their mainland
    terrorist campaigns. The Manchester bombing of (about) 1993 killed at least one
    youth and sliced many people with flying glass.\r\nIf Korea has reason to fear
    terrorist incidents, including from home-grown nutcases, then this isn't necessarily
    an irrational response. (Actually, what they need to do is build deep, conical,
    reinforced rubbish bins that will deflect a blast upwards, and then have them
    emptied regularly. Both of which are infrastructure fixes that take time.)"

  content: "Korea has no reason to fear terrorist incidents whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI haven't
    met Les, and I have no idea about his club. But there's nothing easier than finding
    a baduk club in Seoul. You should look for words 기원 (kiwon) and 바둑 (baduk). Near
    the center, there's one at every corner.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to go to Jongmyo
    shrine (which I recommend highly), stop by at the park just south of it. I'm not
    sure about Korean temperatures now, but if it's not too cold you will find someone
    playing there :)\r\nYou can get there by subway - station 종로3가 (jongno 3-ga).\r\n\r\nDamn
    I miss Korea."

    anticipate working the usual hours (07:00 to 19:00) in the office while I'm there
    (though I'll obviously disappear about 30 seconds after the last of the company
    staff - \"No security card, Boss. Can't stay.\"), but I may manage a day of touristing
    while I'm waiting for a plane.\r\nBut I've printed out your note - thanks - and
    the Hangul has survived the normal mangling of going through UK-centric computers,
    so I don't have to rely on my imperfect rendering of the characters on the back
    of my subway map.\r\nJongno-3-ga  : that's the big subway nexus a few stops north
    of Seoul Station, where the #1, #5, and #3 lines interchange? Well, that's certainly
    reachable, if I'm planning on getting gadgets at Yongsan too. Which I am (don't
    know what gadgets, yet. That's part of the game.).\r\n\r\n<blockquote cite=\"tasuki\">I’m
    not sure about Korean temperatures now, </blockquote>Allegedly they've just had
    more January snow than for decades, leading to much whinging from drilling engineers
    who're unable to drive into the office for the 07:00 conference calls. Australians
    are heading for Seoul from Jakarta for the skiing and to introduce their kids
    to this \"snow\" material. We're seeing 3-7 centigrade out here at sea (close
    to the marine border with Japan), and had about a dozen squid boats around us
    catching tomorrow's dinner last night."

<p>On Thursday, we left <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?KingsBadukCenter">킹스바둑</a> early in the morning. <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?KimSungRae">김성래</a> took us to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul">서울</a>. We did some shopping in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_Baduk_Association">한국기원</a>, and then went to a baduk club, which was rather empty because of holiday. In the evening, we went to <a href="http://www.baduk-academy.com/">IBA</a>, where we were accomodated (thanks to Mr. <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?LeeKiBong">이기봉</a>).</p>
<p>On Friday, we got up rather late, and went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongdaemun_Market">동대문시장</a>. It was quite crowded, not too clean, and I didn't feel like shopping. I left our undecisive group behind and went for a walk along <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheonggyecheon">청계천</a>. I was unpleasantly surprised to find the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namdaemun">남대문</a> hidden in a building (when Koreans repair a building, they build another building wrapped around it). Fortunately, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namdaemun_Market">남대문 시장</a> was open and living. I bought a bulb blower (yes, I already succesfully cleaned my sensor!) and got wonderful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbap">김밥</a> for just 2000. After that, I spent some time wandering the amazingly crowded and cozy streets of Namdaemun and finally emerged by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Korea_Museum">한국은행 화폐금융박물관</a>. Then I went to visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoksugung">덕수궁</a>, a small but nice palace with well groomed gardens and various tourist attractions. It was getting dark, and after watching an outside musical performance (horrible pop music, but so wonderfully Korean that I just had to stop and listen), I found 경복궁 closed. After buying some rice-based sweets (huge bag for 5k), I finished the day taking pics of random passersby in a random nightlife area. A cute girl who studies dancing helped me resolve a problem with subway (the line bifurcates, some trains go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangil-dong">상일</a> and some to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macheon-dong">마천</a>, I didn't know which one I was in).</p>
<blockquote><p>Side note on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul">Hangul</a> (aka Korean letters): I've been in Korea for well over a month, and I couldn't read anything. I didn't even bother trying. I <em>knew</em> Korean letters were complicated. When the frogeater told me that there were just 14 consonants and 10 vowels (grand total of 24 letters), I was very surprised. Well, I learned Hangul in about 15 minutes, because -- behold -- the letters are not only very few, they are also logical (Hangul is artificial alphabet!) and easy to remember. I'm angry at myself for not having done this a long time ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>Saturday, right. Having experienced the immobility of our group the day before, me and the frogeater set out to visit the royal shrine. What was our surprise when we stumbled upon a park full of baduk players! It wasn't too easy to get a game at first, but once I started playing, observers came (a white guy playing baduk, w00t), and after I killed my opponent all over the board (I gave him 5 stones, he was like european 8kyu) everyone was suddenly interested in playing me. I still won most of my games, as these guys lacked any sense of style, but they fought relentlessly. I quickly lost frogeater somewhere in the crowd (obviously, everyone wanted to play him as well).</p>
<p>Several games and one lunch later I decided that was it, and finally went to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jongmyo">종묘</a>. There I met a group of European girls (1 Slovak, 3 French) who had a Korean guide that spoke fluent English. I'm still not sure whether the guide was paid or free for all, but I was invited to join them, so I didn't refuse ;). I proceeded with the girls (one of them even pretended to be interested in go!) to visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changgyeonggung">창경궁</a> and its vast gardens. Then I made a mistake, I parted with the girls, intending to visit the other palace -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changdeokgung">창덕궁</a>. This palace had only one open entrance with a hostile guard who didn't want to let me in and refused to speak English. Finally, one tourist gave me some paper with info on how to get in -- there's a guided tour just thrice a day, otherwise tough luck. Can't recommend this palace.</p>
<p>I read a lot of praise about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukchon_Hanok_Village">북촌한옥마을</a>, so was looking forward to it. I felt I was close, but couldn't quite locate it exactly. After asking the locals about 북촌, they said that I was already there. Turns out, there are historical houses, but they amount for about 5% of randomly placed houses in this quarter. However, I got lucky and met friendly westerners who gave me a nice map of the broader center with pictures of interesting stuff. That map is really good. All maps should have pictures. Well anyway, then I continued on my way only to find out that the museums have mostly been closed already (it was about 6pm), but at least I visited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongbokgung">경복궁</a>. After wandering around aimlessly for a while, a nice middle aged American lady asked me whether I needed help. She'd moved to 서울 recently, but already knows her way around pretty well. We went for a nice Chinese dinner. Then I headed for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insadong">인사동</a> where I bought traditional Korean sweets consisting of nuts wrapped in strings of sugar, which the American lady recommended. Again finished the day shooting random people in the streets, this time in the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeongdong">명동</a> nightlife area. This time it rained. Rain is always good for photos. I was lucky enough to catch the last subway.</p>
<p>Sunday was the last day for sightseeing. I got up early (well, half past eight) and headed for the museums. First I went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Palace_Museum_of_Korea">국립고궁박물관</a>, which has free entry in 2009, as a celebration of 100 years of its history. It was pretty cool, they even allowed photography (“no flash and no tripod”). Then I went to nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Folk_Museum_of_Korea">국립민속박물관</a>, which had nice outside part showing how people lived in various times in Korean history, and inside part with several expositions. After watching traditional dance (there was some sort of EOS 5d users meeting, there were at least 20 ppl, lenses ranging from tiny primes to huge zooms, all with the impossible-to-overlook red stripe). Then I went to the baduk park again. On my way I met a friendly Korean engineering student looking for some English practice. He walked me to the park and gave me a lot of valuable info about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">한국</a>. After playing few games in the park, I got cold, so I went to find some food. I happened to stumble upon a baduk club, where I stayed for just 3k. I got to play many people, one was really strong (beat me two times easily) but the rest were pretty weak. Although I was rather tired and my back hurt pretty bad from the hours of slow walking during the last three days, I went for one more walk along 청계천, and didn't regret it.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with how the trip turned out, I have just two complaints:</p>
<ul>
<li>complete lack of waste bins; I was told it's because of the threat of terrorism (typical Korean overreaction)</li>
<li>annoying notices about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic">H1N1</a> and various countermeasures (overreaction again, Mexico, where H1N1 originated and which was hit worst, has <a href="http://flutracker.rhizalabs.com/">only 33000 cases (0.02% of population), and 350 deaths (1% of the infected people die)</a>)</li>
</ul>
