Yet <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Bushby">Karl Bushby</a> decided to try it. He started in 1998 and now he’s somewhere in Russia, having crossed the dangerous <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bering_Strait">Bering Strait</a>. Karl plans on finishing his more than 50 000 km journey in 2009. It’s almost unbelievable that someone is willing to spend more than 10 years of his life just walking around the world…
