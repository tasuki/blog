<p>They are utterly lame. I can't imagine anything lamer than nicks that just end with numbers because the original nick wasn't available (the exception for this are of course l33t n1ck5, that's acceptable).</p>
<p>I made a small test on <a  href="http://kgs.kiseido.com">KGS</a>, based on knowledge that naruto fans are often dumber than average idiots. Well, of course, there is someone with nick "naruto", that's cool, the guy was first, so he got it. But you can also find "Naruto1", "naruto2", "naruto3" and "Naruto6" (who has email in his profile "kupoman3", this guy is totally hopeless). Then I sorted the list of online users by name, and guess what -- I saw "naruto337" and "Naruto93". Could it even get any worse?</p>
<p>Any sane person will try to come up with an original username, not distinguished by number at the end (I use "tasuki" when available, "sempai" when "tasuki" is already occupied, or "tasukisempai" when in despair (oh yeah, I think I also used "tasuki3" once, but I understood pretty quickly that it's lame)).</p>
<p>Concerning my nickname "tasuki", I made a mistake too. It was back in 2001 or so (well, in this crappy country I didn't even have internet access before) and I thought it was a term describing an opening in go. Had I investigated it all before, I would have found that it also means "kimono sash" and that it's also a character from some crappy anime (or manga, I don't know). I should have chosen the other one I was considering -- "tenuki", but at that time it seemed to me that it was too common word (it's the other way actually) and although I liked it better, I settled on "tasuki" just to be more unique. At least it's not as desperate as "naruto337" and the likes.</p>
<p>If I had the option to choose my online nick again, I would definitely try to come up with something totally unique. While that might be an excuse for numbers ("hey, naruto337 is free anywhere"), the lameness remains pretty high.</p>
