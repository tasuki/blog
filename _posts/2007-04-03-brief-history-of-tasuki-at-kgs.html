<p><a  href="http://www.gokgs.com/">KGS</a> was founded in 2000 by William Shubert.</p>
<p>The first Czech on KGS was probably makov (registered on 3.9.2000).</p>
<p>I registered on 2.12.2001, I'm not sure how I got to know KGS, but I think I was told by makov.</p>
<p>I have no idea when I founded "Český pokoj" (the Czech room). It was probably later than in 2001 and definitely earlier than 2004. But all else remains unknown... I am not even sure who were the first people in it. If anyone knows the details, <strong>tell me!</strong>  :)<br />
I became owner of the rengo room around the end of 2003<br />
The next big thing was summer 2004 - Czech version of CGoban (translated by me). That's also how I became an admin (actually there was one more reason for me to became an admin - several of my friends were already admins).</p>
<p>I spend a great deal of time chatting and idling on KGS, I have many friends there (most of whom I've met in real life), but also many that I only know online.</p>
<p>This must have been a boring post for you (at least it was rather short), but it was very enjoyable for me. ^^</p>
