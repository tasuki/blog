<p>When I first entered the personal agency's office I noticed it was quite luxurious, they have to get a lot of money from their clients...</p>
<p>I was there on time and had to wait for about ten minutes till the interview. The girl was really nice and friendly, but I guess that is her job. When she asked me about wage and I said 20k czk, she concluded that it was too much for someone without experience. Yeah, I knew that, but if I said less than the offer I would only get ripped off, so we ended on minimum 16k czk. I didn't really want to settle on anything but she almost forced me to.<br />
I think her english was worse than mine, which surprised me. Well, she said that my english was okay but that my linux knowledge wasn't good enough for the job. That's ridiculous. She heard me talking english, but she has no idea about my knowledge of linux, only what I told her about it (and I can imagine people knowing next to nothing about linux who would say that they are experts). So in the end she said that my linux knowledge might be okay but my serious lack of experience in documentation creation makes me unsuitable for the place, that it would require working independently and that they want to hire someone experienced in documentation creation or at least publication. Bah, maybe I shouldn't have told her that I know her job is making my wage as low as possible... That prolly made her angry...</p>
<p>Ok, cya... gotta go work on pages & links -> SERPs -> visitors -> profit! :-)</p>
