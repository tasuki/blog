<p>Keo pointed me to a page that has <a  href="http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/history/higinbotham.asp">extensive information about first video game</a>. The game was made in 1958 and played on oscilloscope, which I find utterly hilarious (playing videogames is one of the few things I surely wouldn't use oscilloscope for ;-)).</p>
<p>There is also a <a  href="http://real.bnl.gov/ramgen/bnl/pong.rm">2 minute video</a>, which is worth watching even if you are too lazy to read the text (and you <strong>are</strong> too lazy, I know my readership :-)).</p>
