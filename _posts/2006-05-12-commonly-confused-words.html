<p>There are some words that are often misused. It drives me insane when I see <em>native</em> English speakers use "your" instead of "you're" (I have no problems with "youre", I can decipher that quite easily) and vice versa. Some people also use "their" instead of "they're" or—even worse—instead of "there". I can see no fucking connection between "there" and "their", the words obviously have different root.</p>
<p>As my English education consists mainly of reading/writing, I absorbed at least these simple cases, and totally fail to understand how any native Englishman/American/Aussie with any basic education can make these mistakes (over and over again).</p>
<p>When trying to find out why people so often write "loose" when they mean "lose" (don't ever do that or I'll have to kill you) I found several interesting sites. One said that you can pronounce the word out loud to find out how to write it, that when you pronounce it "lu:s" then you write it as "loose" and when you pronounce it "lu:z" then you write it as "lose". Actually I got just the reversed information from this one – that loose is not pronounced the same as lose. :-)</p>
<p>Then I found a very useful site about <a  href="http://homepage.smc.edu/reading_lab/words_commonly_confused.htm">commonly confused words</a>. The site explains the differencies very clearly and offers short tests to confirm that you understand it.</p>
<p>The words in which people make mistakes but I don't care:<br />
advice/advise, desert/dessert, clothes/cloths, later/latter, it's/its (its basically the same, some people just dont like to write apostrophes), and probably many many more... but I don't care...<br />
The words in which people make mistakes and it annoys me:<br />
accept/except, affect/effect, among/between, farther/further, hear/here, hole/whole, knew/new/knoew/no, <strong>loose/lose</strong>, peace/piece (and what about peas? I guess they forgot), than/then, their/the're/there, threw/through, to/too/two, wear/where/were, your/you're</p>
<p>The words in which I make mistakes and it annoys me:<br />
can/may (depends whether I'm concentrated), fewer/less (I use less exclusively), <strong>lay/lie</strong> (I finally learned the difference <em>today</em> after all these years)</p>
<p>All the rest are the ones I consider unimportant so I just don't bother. ;-)</p>
