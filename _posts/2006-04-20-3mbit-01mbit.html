<p>It hurts.</p>
<p>Because we thought that the limit was 12GB for a week when in fact it is 12GB a month, well, we exceeded the bandtwidth and our connection got highly limited. Now I will have to survive with 30 times slower connection than the one I am used to (downloading 1mb in 3 seconds is kinda neat, downloading 30kB in 3 seconds sucks big time).</p>
<p>Ten days like this... I wonder whether I will survive or just die from lack of connectivity, which became more important than eating, drinking or sleeping for me. ;-)</p>
