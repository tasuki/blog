Long walks, I get plenty of them these days. Usually listening to podcasts. I choose podcasts to learn something, but if you ask me what I listened to a week ago, I probably won't be able to tell. So, if it's just entertainment, I could listen to fiction as well?

It turns out there's plenty of good audiobooks on [LibriVox](https://librivox.org/). Here's Ruth Golding's [list of British readers on Librivox](https://golding.wordpress.com/home/other-british-readers-on-librivox/).

I recently finished listening to [The Count of Monte Cristo](https://librivox.org/the-count-of-monte-cristo-version-3-by-alexandre-dumas/), and the following quote near the end of the book quite struck me:

> There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness. We must have felt what it is to die that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living.
