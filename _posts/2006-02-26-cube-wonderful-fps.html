<p><img align="right" style="margin: 5px" title="cube screenshot" alt="cube screenshot" src="/assets/cube.jpg" />I just finished about half an hour long session of shooting/killing/getting killed. <a  href="http://www.cubeengine.com">Cube</a> is wonderful FPS (First Person Shooter) written by <a  href="http://strlen.com/">Aardappel</a>. It is small (30MB but 25MB is just maps ;-)), free and runs smoothly on my old comp even in 1280x1024.</p>
<p>The game is very fast paced, there isn't much tactic involved, just take the opponents down. :-) I'd invite some additional features like different colours for players and team game and CTF (Capture The Flag), but it seems that the creator isn't going to implement it (he is not really interested in gaming... quite strange).</p>
<p>Anyway the game is very easy to handle and completely addictive. :-)</p>
