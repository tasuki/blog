  content: 'Could have been worse, actually. Yesterday I watched one of my favorite
    movies made by Ghibli - Laputa. It has been finally published in Poland not that
    long ago. I watched it with Polish subtitles turned on. It seems that the ``translation
    path'''' was (at best) Japanese -&gt; English -&gt; Polish. I understand that
    every language has its limitations, style, way of thinking and so on, but it''s
    a strange feeling, when you think: "The other people are watching a <i>different
    movie</i> (at times)!", "Hey! She didn''t say <i>that</i>!" It''s a pity I haven''t
    made any notes - the examples I can think of right now are not even funny.'

  content: Cascaded translations are <b>bad</b>. If it's officially published it should
    definitely be translated <i>directly</i> from the original. And I fear even that
    is quite often rather distorted (either because the translator sucks or because
    it's just impossible to translate).

<p>It shouldn't be much of a surprise to anyone that I used to watch (English) movies with Czech subtitles.</p>
<p>About two years ago I found out that it was a really bad idea. Apart from the subtitles stealing my time because I had to read them, they also stole my brain cycles as I <em>couldn't avoid comparing what I heard in the English original to the Czech translation</em>, looking for what I missed and what I'd translate better. While this might have been a good exercise as far as translation skills are concerned, it made me tired rather quickly. Plus I usually had no idea what the movie was about.</p>
<p>So I switched to English subtitles. That was a great improvement. No more time spent translating everything both ways three times. I could finally enjoy movies again. But still, I couldn't help but read the subtitles anyway, just <em>because they were there</em>.</p>
<p>And so it happened that I almost stopped using subtitles for English movies alltogether. I still occasionally use subtitles for special things such as Monty Python, where there are a lot of jokes and puns which would be difficult for me to catch otherwise.</p>
