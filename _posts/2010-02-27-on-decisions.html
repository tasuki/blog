    There is no reason to think otherwise. The impression of free will we have is
    just an illusion the brain creates, you cannot trust "feelings" like these. All
    processes in the brain can be described by physics – i.e., are deterministic.

    a more serious note, I think that for example quantum physics seems pretty nondeterministic
    to us at the moment."

    right decisions is a good thing. That can't be bad, right?\r\n\r\nAlso, deterministic
    world seems like a great thing – no matter how bad I fuck up, I'll still get
    the predetermined result. No need to worry about anything anymore!"

<p>We have freedom and can make a lot of decisions – isn' it great? On the other hand, we often <em>have to</em> make decisions. I generally don't like making decisions. Making a decision means that I will most probably regret it sooner or later.</p>
<p>I use a regret-based approach to making decisions. I try to estimate the probability that I'll regret the decision. Sometimes, that probability is 100% for one option, so the other option wins by default.</p>
<p>About a year ago, in early 2009, I decided to quit my work and explore Poland. I reached that decision by realising that if I don't do it, I will regret it for sure. My vacation time ended up being almost three times as long as I expected, mostly due to unplanned trip to Korea, which was great. I didn't really have enough money to go there, but I knew I would definitely regret not going. 2009 has definitely been the best year of my life so far.</p>
<p>I wish I could apply this approach to making decisions more broadly, as it rarely fails. There are decisions for which I am fully aware of the right choice, yet can't follow through and end up choosing the bad one.</p>
