<p>I was struggling to pedal my bycicle up the hill, when I saw a memorial with rather weird text (yeah, yeah, I promise I will take my camera next time). It stated something like:</p>
<p>"Made for 500th anniversary of burning <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Hus">Jan Hus</a> to death. Truth prevails."</p>
<p>I guess this is not even a double meaning... seems pretty clear to me. Yet, for some reason, I think it is not what they had in mind... or... could someone elaborate on that?<br />
As a side note, I just found out that wikipedia's <a  href="http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%95%D7%A1">hebrew article about Jan Hus</a> is a <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles">featured article</a>, which is imho pretty cool. And seeing whole wikipedia in right-to-left almost made me fall off my chair (I've got a new chair, did I brag already? (btw see how I change topic all the time without hesitation and don't mind a bit? :-))).</p>
