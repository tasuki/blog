<p>So I finally added social bookmarking sites (those nifty little icons just under each post's title). They allow you to easily bookmark the post in your, ehm, social bookmarks...</p>
<p>I will not go into details, but if you want to know how it works <strong>please</strong> test it on my blog :-)</p>
<p>For the time being there are links to delicious, digg, spurl and reddit. Any other you use/suggest?</p>
<p>As a side note - I made a new header image (taken from my home), I know it is too contrast with the rest of the page, but I am too lazy to remake the whole design just because of this and I really like the picture (about the only photo I've made that I am actually proud of ;-)).</p>
