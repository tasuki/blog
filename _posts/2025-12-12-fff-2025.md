title: Favourite Fonts For 2025
---

I enjoy obsessing about typefaces. They're everywhere, yet often somewhat invisible. I like free things, not just because they're free (as in beer), but also because they can't easily be taken away (as in freedom).

## Alegreya

A workhorse:

- Looks good both small and large.
- [Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alegreya), but also there's a [sans serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alegreya+Sans) version and [small caps](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alegreya+SC) and of course [sans serif small caps](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alegreya+Sans+SC).
- Each of these comes in a myriad of weights, and with *beautiful italics*.
- Discretionary ligatures, lining *and* old style numerals, proportional *and* tabular numerals. Choose any combination!
- Won some awards and [generally gets a lot of praise](https://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/alegreya-ht/).
- Is [on GitHub](https://github.com/huertatipografica/Alegreya).

## Bricolage Grotesque

- Has a [really cool interactive homepage](https://ateliertriay.github.io/bricolage/).
- Looks good both small and large.
- Variable: weight, width, optical size. No italics though!
- Is [on GitHub](https://github.com/ateliertriay/bricolage).

## Recursive

- Has a [really cool interactive homepage](https://www.recursive.design/).
- Looks good both small and large.
- Variable: mono (mono vs proportional & everything inbetween) casualness (casual vs linear & everything inbetween!), weight, slant, cursive.
- Is [on GitHub](https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive).

## Honourable mentions

- The **IBM Plex** family is great: the [Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans) and [Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono) are great and coherent and there's also [Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif).
- [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display) is beautiful but somewhat single use (display!)
