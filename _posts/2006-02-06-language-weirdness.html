<p>In Polish, "piwnica" means cellar, in Czech it would be an archaic term for a pub (with a bit different spelling).</p>
<p>Months are even trickier: April is "duben" in Czech and "kwiecień" in Polish. May is "květen" in Czech and "Maj" in Polish (to make it even more confusing you can use "Maj" for April in Czech as well). So now you can imagine the confusion when we were talking about a go tournament and mentioning that it will be in "kwiecień"...</p>
