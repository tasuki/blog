<p><img align="left" style="margin-right: 5px" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/gonsalves.jpg" />Rob Gonsalves is an exceptional Canadian painter. Wikipedia states that his works can be classified as "magic realism" (someone really should upgrade that awful stud).</p>
<p>I've recently stumbled upon a <a  href="http://www.fashionplace.ru/forum/index.php/topic,5.0.html">collection of Rob Gonsalves' pictures</a> (reading <a  href="http://digg.com">digg</a> is sometimes worth it). It's a thread in a Russian forum, but I think that it doesn't really matter as you don't need to speak Russain to enjoy the pictures.</p>
<p>Concerning the pictures, they are really great and full of interesting things. The one you can see here on the left side includes people with kites, who (clockwise) change to puppets led by those... ummm... not sure what it is, let's call it supernatural being :-)</p>
<p>Now see the Russian forum until you get halfway through to the boy with little train in a dark room. I had very similar nightmares when I was a kid (like 7 or so I think). It wasn't a train though, I was just playing with a small marble when a fucking huge globe appeared from nowhere and started very slowly coming in my direction. But since it was so fucking big, there was no point in trying to run, I'd get crushed anyway. Usually woke up with all my pyjamas totally sweaty. The nasty thing was that I had the dream several times, and the comparison between the tiny marble and the huge sphere... brrr, makes me shiver even now...</p>
