<p>I just found out that there are tournaments in <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%2C_Paper%2C_Scissors">rock, paper, scissors</a>. Not only that, they have various <a  href="http://www.worldrps.com/">official organizations</a> and arrange tournaments (there's also some not small prize money), there are many <a  href="http://www.worldrps.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=28">strategies</a>, some of which I find <a  href="http://www.worldrps.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=20&Itemid=33">incredibly funny</a> (please read the descriptions of the gambits carefully, I almost fell of my chair  o_O).</p>
<p>There is also a <a  href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~darse/rsbpc.html">computer rock, paper, scissors championship</a>, which is much more interesting, but I feel waaay too tired now  :yawn: so I leave the rest to curious readers (yeah, my readers are actually more lazy than curious, but whatever...)</p>
