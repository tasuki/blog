title: Consumption vs creation
---

Some people think screen-time = bad. Or that smart phones = bad. I think it's mostly creation vs consumption, no matter the medium.

Creation = good.  
Comsumption = bad.

Scrolling Instagram (TikTok? whatever people use these days...) is consumption (bad). Posting on Instagram: creation (good). Checking instagram followers: consumptive (bad).

Of course it's a spectrum. Playing computer games is more consumptive than creating them, but probably more creative than scrolling Instagram. It also depends on the particular game, playing Factorio being more creative than playing Farmville.

I've been doing ok recently wrt consumption vs creation, I don't consume much and mostly spend my little free time creating. See, even now I'm creating this blog post (good). While you're reading it (bad). Stop and go create something!
