<em>“I live my life one stone at a time; for that one stone, nothing else matters, not my school, not the disgusting world.”</em>

I thought that this quote just deserved a special post. I found it in <a  href="http://kgs.kiseido.com">KGS’</a> user info of suilki.

The more I read it the more I like it. Any explanation seems to be just twaddle, you have to feel the same way to understand it.
