  content: Hollywood melodrama, meh. An intelligent non-documentary movie about WWII
    still needs to be made.

    consider intelligent?\r\n\r\nBy the way, I watched The Pianist yesterday. While
    it was an intense movie and I enjoyed it, the dialogues in Schindler's List were
    just way better."

  content: Schindler's List is great. One of the very rare movies which touches me
    on an emotional level, rather than just presenting itself for my intellectual
    scrutinization.

    sucks. A slew of stereotypical \"evil\" Germans, with the token \"good\" German
    with a noble face thrown in. It's ridiculous really. If you want to see a serious
    film about the war, go see \"Shoah\" by Claude Lanzmann."

    even write that in one post? :-P\r\n\r\nFor me, Pulp Fiction might be one of the
    worst movies I've ever seen (I haven't seen many, though). What's so great about
    it?\r\n\r\nOn a completely unrelated note, today I was asked to go see \"Lost
    Highway\" tomorrow. Although I didn't really feel like going, seeing it in your
    list made me reconsider :)"

    script, acting, music, memorable and colorful characters. Oh and did I mention
    the visual style? And the characters and their lines..?\r\n\r\nJust not you kind
    of movie I guess. I remember being surprised when you burned it in one of your
    blog posts  :-)"

  content: "Oh, and I don't think you will like Lost Highway. The story is very unusual
    and disjointed, and presented in a very.. strange way. It may just seem a collection
    of bizarre scenes to you (his later movies went too much in this direction). With
    Lynch it is always as much about atmosphere and his amazing filming, as it is
    about the story.\r\n\r\nImo you should see Brazil or one of the Kubrick movies.
    Kubrick is by far my favorite director."

    sure I haven't missed anything... and... nope, I haven't :-|\r\nThe visual style...
    ok... it was kind of good, I admit.\r\n\r\nStill I can't get rid of the feeling
    that the movie didn't even try to get some message accross.\r\n\r\nAs for Lost
    Highway... I'll just decide tomorrow based on my momental mood ^^"

  content: "Didn't \"even\" try to get a message across? So every movie has to have
    some kind of message?  I begin to fear you reaction to Lost Highway... If you
    see it, please post you opinion :-)\r\n\r\nTarantino's style of dialogue is not
    one which you can quote somewhere and marvel how much substance it has, like the
    ones you quoted from Schindler's List. It's street language, a parody and tribute
    to 80-ies gangster movies, with a quite witty kind of humor. The exchange about
    french fries and bic macs is for example pretty much a classic (and I find it
    quite funny). There is a lot of wit, humor and juggling with conventions in how
    the situations are played out.\r\n\r\nBut I think I can see how all of this may
    not be one's cup of tea..."

  content: "\"Pulp Fiction\" deserves recognition as a work of art for the nonchronological
    order alone. Have you even thought about what order the events in the movie take
    place?\r\n\r\nAs for message, you did notice that Vincent ends up dead, whereas
    Jules doesn't, right? Of course, there's some christianized bla-bla around it
    which makes one want to ignore it, but still, it's there.\r\n\r\nOf course, anything
    by Kubrick is better, yeah..."

  content: "Yes, I noticed the nonchronological order... but it was more frustrating
    than interesting to me (same as in Kafka's \"Der Process\" – which means, by the
    way, that it wasn't that original in Pulp Fiction ;)).\r\n\r\nAs for the message
    – I think you did your best trying to find it. :P\r\nI have to agree that it's
    an interesting point (and I admit I didn't realize it).\r\n\r\nI guess I'm going
    to watch something by Kubrick, since everyone seems to recommend him (not only
    here but generally)."

  content: You could try Space Odyssey (Kubrick) if you haven't seen it yet, it's
    classic (though kinda weird, I've never seen it whole way through). Or if you
    want to take my advice, go to see Interstate 60, K-Pax or Butterly Effect. I wouldn't
    say that those are top class movies, but they are all likeable (me and my sister's
    favourites) which even can carry some message. But maybe you should see Interstate
    60 only after some time, first I want to ask you some questions in real life ;).

<p>I recently watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List">Schindler's List</a> and it was a very intense experience. You can read the movie reviews elsewhere, so I will just share transcripts (shamelessly <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List">stolen from wikiquote</a>) of two dialogs that I really liked:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Goeth</strong>: You know, I look at you. I watch you. You're not a drunk. That's, that's real control. Control is power. That's power.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: Is that why they fear us?<br />
<strong>Goeth</strong>: We have the fucking power to kill, that's why they fear us.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: They fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily. A man commits a crime, he should know better. We have him killed and we feel pretty good about it. Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better. That's not power, though, that's justice. That's different than power. Power is when we have every justification to kill – and we don't.<br />
<strong>Goeth</strong>: You think that's power.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: That's what the emperors had. A man stole something, he's brought in before the emperor, he throws himself down on the ground, he begs for mercy, he knows he's going to die. And the emperor pardons him. This worthless man, he lets him go.<br />
<strong>Goeth</strong>: I think you are drunk.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: That's power, Amon. That is power. <em>[gestures toward Goeth as a merciful emperor]</em> Amon, the Good.<br />
<strong>Goeth</strong>: <em>[He smiles and laughs]</em> I pardon you.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn9rWU1AuIM">watch "control is power" on youtube</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Stern</strong>: We've received an angry complaint from the Armaments Board. The artillery shells, tank shells, rocket casings, apparently all of them have failed quality-control tests.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: Well, that's to be expected – start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans. This is a precise business. I'll write them a letter.<br />
<strong>Stern</strong>: They're withholding payment.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: Sure. So would I. So would you. I wouldn't worry about it. We'll get it right one of these days.<br />
<strong>Stern</strong>: There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines. They could shut us down, send us back to Auschwitz.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: I'll call around, find out where we can buy shells, pass them off as ours.<br />
<strong>Stern</strong>: I don't see the difference. Whether they're made here or somewhere else.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: You don't see a difference? I see a difference.<br />
<strong>Stern</strong>: You'll lose a lot of money, that's the difference.<br />
<strong>Schindler</strong>: Fewer shells will be made. Stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired, I'll be very unhappy. </p></blockquote>
