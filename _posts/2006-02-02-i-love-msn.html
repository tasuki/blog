<p>Yeah, I love msn because MSN loves me.</p>
<p>My positions skyrocketed there without any problems, might just get a few more links to reach the total top.</p>
<p>quit smoking now - my pages are on position 22 out of 1 027 846, not bad at all, considering the competition and age of my pages less than a month...</p>
<p>here we go - 20 out of 68 062 070, also very nice (cca two weeks old pages). 68 millions pages... that is a hell lot of pages...</p>
<p>network security introduction - <strong>3</strong> out of 2 365 142, third, yup, that is <em>very</em> neat...</p>
<p>Now the drawbacks: In spite of good positions MSN drives me almost no traffic, I wonder whether people just do not search for these phrases at all, or whether it is caused by too few people using MSN search (hey, use MSN search, it rocks ;-)).</p>
<p>And both Yahoo and Google completely ignore me. Well, they have my pages indexed, but that's about it, I am nowhere in SERPs (unless I search very specifically for keywords like "quit smoking now tasuki", but who would ever search for that?). I hope that as my links age a bit, I will get better SERPs on Yahoo and Google as well.</p>
