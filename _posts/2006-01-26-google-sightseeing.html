<p>Google offers several great services, one of them is <a  href="http://maps.google.com/maps?t=k">google maps</a>. It consists of satelite photos of Earth. You can have a look at where go tournament in Brno takes place - <a  href="http://www.google.com/maps?t=k&hl=en&ll=49.230308,16.518588&spn=0.004463,0.010911&t=k">Santon hotel</a>.</p>
<p>I recently stumbled upon <a  href="http://googlesightseeing.com">Google sightseeing</a>, which is a site having links to various interesting things on google maps. Much easier than actually travelling. ;-)</p>
