How could have they done this? I mean, if you live somewhere, and someone you don’t even know just tells you that your home is not your anymore and that they already moved you to 85.71.208.20, how would you feel? Yeah, you wouldn’t even care. But I already got used to my good old 83.208.183.167 and now I miss it.

Sry, it’s still too early in the morning (ever noticed that it’s either too early or too late or I am tired for another reason?).
