Helium Vola is a German Darkwave or “Electro-Medieval” band, at least that is what <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_Vola">wikipedia says</a>. But the article is a stub and there isn’t much more info. There is a bit more on <a  href="http://www.last.fm/music/Helium+Vola">last.fm</a>, but nothing special. Amazons has a <a  href="http://www.amazon.com/Helium-Vola-Omnis-Mundi-Creatura/dp/B00005QZAC">few good comments</a> on the album.

After searching for half an hour or so, I even managed to find <a  href="http://lyriki.com/Helium_Vola:Helium_Vola_%282001%29">Helium Vola lyrics</a>. This page has no pagerank and I am not sure anymore how I found it, anyway, I am pretty sure it’s about the only page with complete Helium Vola lyrics (as you will see if you search for snippets of the text). Quite funny that the main page of something as wonderful as <a  href="http://lyriki.com/Main_Page">Lyriki</a> (they have shitloads of lyrics and no ads whatsoever, as opposed to all the lyrics sites which are virtually cluttered by ads) has only PageRank 2. Gotta share some google love…

And now for something completely different: my impressions. My first most favourite song was of course…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Omnis Mundi Creatura</strong>
</p>
<p>
Omnis mundi creatura<br />
quasi liber et pictura<br />
nobis est in speculum.<br />
Omnis mundi creatura<br />
quasi liber et pictura<br />
nobis est in speculum.
</p>
<p>
Nostrae vitae, nostrae mortis<br />
nostri status, nostrae sortis<br />
fidele signaculum.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is not the full lyrics, just a highlight… The melody is very catchy but it can get on your brain a bit after a while…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Les Habitants Du Soleil</strong>
</p>
<p>
Les habitants du soleil jettent sur nous un regard impassible<br />
Nous appartenons définitivement á la Terre<br />
Et nous y pourrirons, mon amour impossible<br />
Jamais nos corps meurtris ne deviendront lumière
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I completely love the atmosphere of the “sun inhabitants”, especially the male voice “nous apartenons definitivement a la terre” contrasted with the female voice… extatic.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Je Chante Par Couverture</strong>
</p>
<p>
Je chante par couverture<br />
Mais mieulx plourassent mi oeil<br />
Ne nul ne scet le traveil<br />
Que mon pouvre cuer endure
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Very captivating song, repeating the title over and over, yet it never gets boring. :-)
</p>
<p>
Next great song is <strong>Do Tagte Ez</strong>, however, it’d be a bit difficult to pick up part of the lyrics (it has no refrain), definitely the most “magical” song of the entire album (where most of the songs are rather magical). And I can’t omit mentioning <strong>Selig</strong>, which is the last song of the album, and has an extremely catchy and merry melody.
</p>

And in case you are now wondering how comes that some lyrics are Latin, some French, and some German… all the lyrics from Helium Vola are based on various medieval texts (feel free to google them to find out more).
