  content: I'm fairly sure it was some girl that had a crush on you back then. They
    always give those 'obvious' signs that men don't get and since you're a man there
    is no way you'll ever figure out that clue ;)

  content: "I thought that someone would think something like that. :-P\n\nBut
    I'm fairly sure that this was not the case &ndash; the girls were interested in
    other guys… and (even more importantly), if it indeed was the case, the book
    would have been different (at least I think so ^^)."

<p>"Little Feather McAbony" (the Czech title is "Dál než východ slunce") is the title of a book written by Eran Kroband.</p>
<p>I got this book for Christmas, back in high school, a few years ago. And now comes the queer part – I don't know who gave it to me.</p>
<p>In high school, we used to give each other just <em>very</em> small presents (like funny pencil or something similar). This was a hardcover book, that in itself made it quite special. First I thought it was a kind of game, the person who gave it to me hiding and letting me guess. I read the book, and although I enjoyed it, I was not a bit closer to knowing whom I got it from. So then I went around asking people, but no one knew anything. Someone obviously had to put the book under the tree, right? It's not like this was ever done ultra secretly…</p>
<p>I've had the book for several years, read it several times, and searched for any possible clues (in the storyline, something marked somewhere, etc) to no avail…</p>
