<p>Ok, life's a mess. I bought my own domain recently and started uploading stuff. You can view some new photos from recent <a href="http://photo.tasuki.org/vitek/2005/12-TriStudne/">trip to Tri Studne</a>. Yeah, half of them are photos of my ex-gf, guess why... And to make it worse school exams are approaching.</p>
