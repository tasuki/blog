<p>I was really surprised when I was getting my system password at school. I got a paper with all the students' names, and was told to rewrite mine. Noone would really care if I wrote down several others. Then I was required to sign the paper confirming that I got the password.</p>
<p>This whole process is so utterly ridiculous, I had to sign the paper, which makes it look like something important, but on the other hand I was shown passwords of dozens of other people (together with usernames, of course).</p>
