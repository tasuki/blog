<p><img align="left" alt="singing bush" style="margin-right: 10px" title="singing bush" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/singing-bush.png" />Winter is pretty quiet time of a year. Considering birds, crows sometimes caw, but there's almost no beeping (except PC speaker (especially for vim beginners)) during winter.</p>
<p>However, on my way to school I walk past <a  href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=42.360237,89.296875&z=17&ll=49.217716,16.57927&spn=0.004282,0.013561&t=k&om=1">this bush</a>, that is very, very loud. The beeping is particularly intensive during morning, my educated guess is that it keeps people living in radius of about one kilometer awake.</p>
<p>I have always wondered where all the birds disappear when it's winter â€“ and now I finally know...</p>
