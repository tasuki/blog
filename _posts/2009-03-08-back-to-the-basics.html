<p>Almost everyone, myself included, underestimates the basics.</p>
<p>If you want to be an expert in any field, you need very strong basics. When you don't know the basics, you tend to make many mistakes which are hard to get rid of. We are ambitious so we dive deep into all sorts of advanced stuff, leaving the basics for later, perhaps thinking we will somehow figure the basics out along the way. This sometimes works, but more often it doesn't.</p>
<p>So, back to the basics for me! (in what, you ask? -- in everything!)</p>
