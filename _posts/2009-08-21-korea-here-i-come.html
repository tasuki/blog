<p>My blog is dead. Long live my blog!</p>
<p>My plans have changed. I am going to Korea for three months to study go. Then I'm going back to Amsterdam, almost moneyless, to begin <em>the</em> new life.</p>
<p>You can have a look at <a href="http://gallery.tasuki.org/2009">amazing amounts of new photos</a>.</p>
<p>The EGC was mostly eneventful. After a promising first week, second week was a small disaster.</p>
<p>I am in Amsterdam now. I love Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I'm flying to Korea. I was urged (by several people!) to put some info from Korea here – I will try not to disappoint you.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
