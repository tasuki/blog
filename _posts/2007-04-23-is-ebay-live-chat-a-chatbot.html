<p>I tried registering on eBay today. Their help pages say that there are two ways to <a  href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/new/contextual/RegisterVerifyOrEmail.html">verify an account</a> — either credit card (I don't have any) or certain email address. First I tried my gmail account, which obviously didn't work. The next step was an email on the domain tasuki.org, which I own (it is easily possible to verify that by a whois search).</p>
<p>That didn't work either, so I decided to contact <a  href="https://cschatlb-na.corp.ebay.com/chat.asp?profile=12">eBay Live Chat</a> for help:</p>

<td>Marnie B.</td>
<td>I'd be glad to assist you on that!</td>

<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>I don't have a credit card, I have a paypal though</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>and I wonder what kind of email address I have to enter so that it verifies me</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>I tried a gmail address, which didn't work, then I tried address on my domain that I own, didn't work either :(</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>I have a school address, but I'd prefer not to leak the information out</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>(I don't want my school to have any info about my ebay account, that is)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marnie B.</td>
<td>I'm sorry to hear of the trouble. Let me see what I can do on my end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>could you tell me what kind of email is enough to verify me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marnie B.</td>
<td>Thanks for asking. What I can suggest you to use is your work email or paid email address if you have one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>well, the email address on my own domain is not enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>I think that is a paid email address :)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>and the owner info for that domain is publicly available</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>but it still asked me for credit card information</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>the domain is tasuki.org, if it helps you :)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marnie B.</td>
<td>I see. Actually paid email address can be use as an alternative because it may reduce the chance of being asked for a credit card...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>a whois search shows that tasuki.org is indeed owned by me</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>isn't that enough to verify me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marnie B.</td>
<td>But if you're still being asked for it, I believe you really have to enter those information. But you can try your school email if you want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>how is it decided which email is good enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marnie B.</td>
<td>Honestly I'm not sure because our system is the one who verifies the email address.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marnie B.</td>
<td>You would only know if you won't be asked for a credit cared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marnie B.</td>
<td>*credit card</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>sigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marnie B.</td>
<td>I appreciate your interest in doing business with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>so I am going to try my various random email addresses... but I think it's pretty strange that my email address on a domain which I apparently own is not good enough</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100px">Vit Brunner</td>
<td>that's actually about the best verification you can get</td>
</tr>

<p>The rest of the chat sadly got lost because the chat was ended by Marnie B. which caused the window to close suddenly. Anyway, I think this is enough to see what the conversation looked like. The answers were either rather general or completely off. The typo and its correction is a bit suspicious though — would they really create a bot this sneaky? To be sincere, I am not sure.</p>
<p>I tried it once more and got to talk with Joy D. That was quite tiring, as Joy D obviously didn't understand my problem with verification very well and kept insisting on me trying a different browser (I use firefox and Joy D said I should try Internet Explorer). This is exactly what bots do — when they don't know, they switch to a different topic. On the other hand, Joy D seemed a bit too confused to be a bot. So, I really don't know.</p>
<p>I hope I persuaded you to try <a  href="https://cschatlb-na.corp.ebay.com/chat.asp?profile=12">eBay Live Chat</a> yourself, please share your experience! :)</p>
