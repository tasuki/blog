  content: "Considering that Das Grosse Lalula encodes a chess endgame in German chess
    notation, it makes absolutely perfect sense to translate this \"nonsense poem\"
    into Czech.\r\n\r\nAnd even if it did not, the original Lalula sounds like German
    nonsense and you want Czech nonsense, right? ;) There you go again, translation
    is logical and needed. \r\n\r\nMoron."

  content: When Lewis Carroll wrote his Jabberwocky in Alice in Wonderland, he used
    words having more connotations than actual sense. Morgenstern went even further
    and just sounds have connotations in German. As you fail being a native German,
    these connotations are empty or blind for you. But not for Germans! And I see
    nothing wrong for a bilingual poet trying to transpose german sounds evokiíng
    certain feelings into sounds which would evoke the same feelings in a native Czech
    reader. This makes perfect sense to me. By the way, I am a translator myself.

<p>The poem on the left side was written by Christian Morgenstern. This version is the "German" original. The right side version is the "Czech" translation.</p>
<p>Well, anyone who writes poems only with words that have no sense probably suffers from serious brain damage. But maybe he was just making fun of people actually publishing and buying this crap...</p>
<p>But anyone who <em>translates</em> such a poem to another language must be a total moron. Yeah, go ahead and write your own bullshit poem, but please don't call it a translation to sell better...</p>
