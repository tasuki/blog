<p>Make any kind of crap, use <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a>, call it web2.0, and it <strong>will</strong> be succesful. At least that is what Microsoft seems to think.</p>
<p>They recetly released www.live.com (sry, no link for the bastards (yeah, I know they rank me well as opposed to google, but still...)), which is a perfect example how <strong>not</strong> to do AJAX. It looks rather nice at the first sight, I really liked that, but then I tried to search for something and there goes any enthusiasm. The scrolling is about as annoying and user unfriendly as it can possibly get. Browsers had a scroll bar, you know, Microsoft? Nope. Instead, there is this AJAXed scrolling which looks super cool, but which is almost unusable as it doesn't let you navigate in the search results very comfortably. To say something positive, I like that you can choose how much informations about the results you want to view, that is handy.</p>
<p>Now if you do not know the powerrrr AJAX has, you might want to look at <a  href="http://pixoh.com/">pixoh</a>, online picture editor or <a  href="http://www.writely.com/">writely</a>, a word processor. Oh yeah, and while we are at it, I am just writing in this AJAXified wysiwyg (what ya see is what ya get) interface of <a  href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>. Give it a try, Wordpress rulez!</p>
