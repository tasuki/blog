<p>I haven't written a post about music for a long long time. I wanted to write about Nightwish's "new" album Dark Passion Play, but since it can be summed up with "pretty good album, too bad the new singer's voice is nowhere near Tarja's" and since everyone and their dog already knows Nightwish, it wouldn't be too enlightening.</p>
<p>In January I was searching for some good French music (since I like listening to French language) and so I asked scurge (I'd really like to link him, since he's starting a go school, but sadly he has no webpage yet -- anyway, if you are looking for a go teacher, check out "scurge" on KGS (he's way stronger than the kgs 4d he has)) for suggestions. He told me to try Louise Attaque and remarked that they are "a bit weird".</p>
<p>So, yes, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Louise+Attaque">Louise Attaque</a> are a bit weird, but they are also absolutely awesome. Their music is pretty original, I've never heard anything similar before. And I can listen to their songs over and over and over and over and over and...</p>
<p>They have released three albums so far:</p>
<p><strong>Louise Attaque</strong><br />
This self-titled album is their first and in my opinion also the best. J't'emmene au vent is my favourite Louise Attaque song (it also has a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=0emXuhPTWUM">cool video</a>). Other extremely good songs are Ton invitation, Les nuits parisiennes and Fatigante (funny changes in rhythm and speed all the time).</p>
<p><strong>Comme on a dit</strong><br />
Also the best album. I haven't listened to this one as many times as the other two, but I'm trying to catch up. The best song here is <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=yAYKvHXXe0w">La plume</a>, people say it has a clever text -- I think it's about time for me to start learning French. Other notable songs include (but are not limited to) Tu dis rien, Sans filet, Tout Passe, Comme on a dit and Du nord au sud.</p>
<p><strong>A Plus Tard Crocodile</strong><br />
Their last album is not as fantastic as the previous two... nevertheless, there are several pretty good songs: Revolver, Oui non, Nos Sourires (except the last minute, which is horrible) and Depuis Toujours (the best song from the album, imho).</p>
<p>Oh well, at least I managed not to list <em>all</em> the songs from each album. :-)</p>
