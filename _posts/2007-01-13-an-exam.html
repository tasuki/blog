  content: lol, why did you skip those questions?? :) there is always a chance you'll
    get at least 1 point here and there, the way you do it luck isn't even a factor.
    this time you got away with it but lady luck might not be so easy on you next
    time for pulling a stunt like this :D

    answers in formula g(x)\nAnd we have the answer.\n\nSomtimes you can even
    get up to 50% scores &gt;_"

  content: I would like to have students like Vitek … when I was teaching in France,
    I had to correct about 50 tests of 6-8 pages each, written by hand in a language
    wich is not my mother language. Many of the students tried Merlijn tactics, filling
    pages by random equations not connected with the problem … terrible. Some even
    protested and asked points for that mess, arguing that they wrote so many correct
    equations! You are my hero, V. (But derivative is so easy …)

The other day I had an exam. It’s almost half of January, technically middle of winter, yet the temperature was around 10˚C in the morning. My one-hour walk to school was nice and helped me to relax before the exam. After seeing the test I was even happier, most of it was real easy. So I concentrated on the easy parts, and seeing that I already have more than 75 points (out of 100) and being sure that it’s completely correct, I decided not to try to write anything to the remaining two tasks (I prefer to write nothing than crap, I think it just looks better).
</p>
<p>
After getting out, I discussed the test with other students and one girl said that the prefessor doesn’t really care about most of the tasks and doesn’t really count the points… That the only important thing is that you get the derivative right. Crap… Shit… Why does this always happen to me? Why didn’t I know it earlier? Why did I decide to <em>skip</em> differentiations when learning for the exam?<br />
Endless waiting in a corridor. The percentage of oxygen ten times less than usual. Fainting every while. Students disappearing from the row, and then coming out of the room either very happy or angry or just plain resigned. Finally, my turn… I find my papers and present them to the professor: “Hmmm, where’s the derivative?”, “umm, well, somehow, you know…”, “without the derivation I can’t let you pass… why didn’t you do the derivative…?” think, think, think, what can I tell him? Silence. “Ok, you’ll get another function to differentiate, last chance”. Crap.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, the one I got was rather easy, so I managed to do it and passed, but… it was close…
</p>
<p>
If I failed I would have to spend another whole day there (not to talk about also having to learn derivations), thank god…
