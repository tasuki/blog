<p>Back when I hated Unity, I wrote down <a href="/make-ubuntu-unity-usable-in-five-simple-steps/">some steps to make it nicer</a>. Well I'm still on Ubuntu (which might change soon - snaps suck), and these days like to hate on Gnome.</p>
<p>I've since <a href="https://github.com/tasuki/dotrc/blob/master/.Xmodmap">moved some settings to config files</a>, but most of the setup is still manual and will keep evolving as Gnome keeps breaking things.</p>
<p>Start by installing <code>gnome-tweak-tool</code>. Under "Windows", choose "Focus on Hover", perhaps tweak some other settings, and then install the Extensions.</p>
<p>Gnome ignores <code>~/.xsession</code>, <code>~/.xinitrc</code> etc, so under "Keyboard & Mouse", choose "Additional Layout Options" and "Ctrl position" and "Swap Ctrl and Caps Lock". Also "Switching to another layout", "Two shifts together". </p>
<p>Must have, without these I'd off Gnome:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1485/workspace-matrix/">Workspace Matrix</a> - my virtual desktops must be in a grid. In settings, select "Show workspace grid in the overview".</li>
<li><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2015/no-title-bar-forked/">No Title Bar - Forked</a> - Vertical space is precious, don't take it away from me. There used to be "Pixel Saver", then "No Title Bar", and now "No Title Bar - Forked". Gnome keeps breaking things, extension developers can't keep up.</li>
<li><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3010/system-monitor-next/">System Monitor Next</a> - I really need to see what my system is doing. Same story as above, there are many versions, most no longer work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice to have:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/779/clipboard-indicator/">Clipboard Indicator</a> - what it says on the box.</li>
<li><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/800/remove-dropdown-arrows/">Remove Dropdown Arrows</a> - they're useless and when there are too many things the whole bar gets messed up.</li>
<li><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1011/dynamic-panel-transparency/">Dynamic Panel Transparency</a> - hey it looks nice.</li>
</ul>
