  content: Could be due to increased mental activity. Your brain needs to rid itself
    of several waste products and drinking is the way to accomplish it. Actually this
    is not uncommon. I noticed this in many of my working friends. Try also some green
    tea. It's health, reduced the prospects of prostate cancer and free radicals and
    other such things that tap water doesn't. Incidentally you prolly read the digg
    article lately about (low doses of) all kinds of medicines being found in all
    kinds of drinking water.

    sounds kind of nasty, I guess I'll go and get it checked...

<p>I think I have a drinking problem.</p>
<p>During all of my life, it was enough for me to drink 4-5 glasses (slightly over a liter) a day. I was never thirsty and often had to force myself to even drink at all.</p>
<p>Recently, this has changed tremendously â€“ I drink over 4 liters a day. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I drink water almost exclusively. I used to drink a lot of sweet carbonated water, but now I can't stand it. It leaves a very annoying aftertaste (funnily, I used to think exactly that about pure water). I am not sure when I started drinking water so much, but I think it was around last summer. I usually drink just tap water, and at work there are big canisters with water kind of similar to tap water.</p>
<p><em>*Think think think... There must be some kind of a point at the end... Or just something...*</em></p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what could have been the cause of such a dramatic change in the amount of water (or liquid, if you prefer) I drink daily?</p>
