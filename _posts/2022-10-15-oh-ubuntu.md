title: Oh Ubuntu
---

I've been a happy Ubuntu user for 17 years, since 2005.

Ubuntu always pushes something on me I don't want. They pushed Unity, and I hated it. Then Unity was replaced by stock Gnome and I longed for Unity. I got used to Gnome by now. It actually is [pretty](https://github.com/tasuki/dotrc/blob/master/gnome3.sh) [customizable](https://github.com/tasuki/dotrc/blob/master/gnome3-internet.sh).

Snaps. Everyone hates them. I swore I'd switch to Debian because of snaps. And yet... I'm on Ubuntu 20.04 and my neovim is old. I'd like to try a newer neovim. Well, `apt remove neovim && snap install nvim`. Eh, that was almost too easy?
