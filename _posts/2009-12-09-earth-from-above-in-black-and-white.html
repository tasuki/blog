<p>On my way from Korea back to Europe, I had an amazing flight.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/photos/25-I-believe-I-can-fly.jpg" class="alignnone" width="510" height="230" /></p>
<p>My original flight got cancelled. But Finnair quickly found a ticket with KLM for me. Direct flight to Amsterdam.</p>

<p>When getting the ticket I asked for a seat next to a window. I thought that the guy didn't understand or care what I said. He seemed completely oblivious to my request.</p>

<p>But as you can see, I got the seat next to the window.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/photos/28-and-ocean.jpg" class="alignnone" width="400" height="600" /></p>
<p>The weather was great. There were amazing clouds as we flew over the yellow sea.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/photos/29-northern-china.jpg" class="alignnone" width="400" height="600" /></p>
<p>This is somewhere in northern China. That's what the flight attendant told me.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/photos/30-gobi.jpg" class="alignnone" width="510" height="340" /></p>
<p>The Gobi desert.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/photos/31-clouds-over-gobi-desert.jpg" class="alignnone" width="510" height="352" /></p>
<p>Slightly cloudy.</p>

<p>Patterns. If you look closely you can see few roads down there.</p>
<p>I'm really happy with how these pictures turned out.</p>

<p>This flight, especially the amazing Gobi desert, was one of the strongest experiences in my life.</p>
