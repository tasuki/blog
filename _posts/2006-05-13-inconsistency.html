Sometimes I write a post (or just intend to write it, like now) about a website that is completely in czech language. It makes no sense to write that in english, since any potential visitor has to know czech rather well to enjoy the site. On the other hand it wouldn’t make sense writing half blog posts in czech and half in english, or would it?
