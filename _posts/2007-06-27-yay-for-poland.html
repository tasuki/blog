<p>I'm going to spend afternoon with my ex-classmates, watching photos from Australia. After that I take overnight train to Warsaw. There I will attend a tournament during the weekend. The week after that is going to consist mostly of sightseeing Poland and just having fun. And then next two weeks on <a  href="http://lsg.go.art.pl">LSG</a>.</p>
<p>Ideal vacations.</p>
