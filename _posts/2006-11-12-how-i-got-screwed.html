<p>The participation at the Czech go championship used to be almost for free, sometimes we even got money for each won game (not much, but still).</p>
<p>This year, everything has changed – almost 100€ for entry fee + accommodation. I don't want to spend that much money for something that <em>should</em> be free (I already placed third in the qualification tournament series and earned my right to play at the championship, why pay for it?).</p>
<p>When I complained about the price, I was told that: today it is not much money, and my go club could pay that for me. Well, I'm not going to ask my go club for any money, because I barely ever go there and don't even pay the annual club fee... that would be just plain unfair.</p>
<p>The other day I learned that one guy (who wasn't even qualified in top ten and but placed 18th in the qualification) got around 90% discount (because he was a student - but hey, I'm a student too).</p>
<p>If they think, that after this I'm going to help with transmitting the games on KGS... well... bwahahahahaha...</p>
