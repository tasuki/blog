<p>I've recently read <a href="http://robrhinehart.com/?p=298">How I Stopped Eating Food</a> and think the author is nuts. Rob claims his wonder-potion helped him clear his to-do list and got him rid of his coffee addiction. While his approach is questionable, I've long shared many of his goals, such as a healthy and balanced diet, while not wasting time preparing food.</p>
<p>Here are some dishes I've been cooking lately:</p>
<ul>
<li>First my absolute favorite: fast, clean and super-healthy. Take broccoli/cauliflower/spinach/green beans/other vegetable. Wash, cut up in a couple of pieces, put in a plastic box, add a bit of water, and microwave between one and three minutes. Steamed vegetables retain both their taste and vitamins. Meanwhile, grate some cheese to sprinkle on top and wash side-dish tomatoes/paprika/carrots/other vegetables. Add a bit of pepper and pour olive oil over it all. Voila, that took about 7 minutes, dirty dishes amount to one plastic box and the grater.</li>
<li>Preheat oven. Wrap fish in aluminium foil and put it in the oven. Go read a book for 10 minutes. Wash side-dish vegetables and perhaps cut a slice of bread. No dirty dishes.</li>
<li>Scrambled eggs are pushing it, preparation takes like 15 minutes and there's the dirty pan left afterwards. But sometimes I still enjoy them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I eat tomatoes and paprika with almost every meal. For meals without much protein, I add few slices of dead animals. If the dish doesn't have enough fat, I add generous amount of olives and snack nuts afterwards. Oh and I've just discovered avocados!</p>
<p>Breakfast is my guilty pleasure, oats (+ banana and nuts) with yogurt, often times of Greek variety, with 15 grams of saturated fat per half-a-cup, instantly getting to 75% of maximum recommended daily saturated fat intake. Oh well.</p>
