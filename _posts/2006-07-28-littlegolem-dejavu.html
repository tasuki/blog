<p>The Littlegolem's disk crashed.  :(</p>
<p>The owner's notebook with backups from last week... crashed...  :(</p>
<p>So the last backup is from May... <em>sigh...</em></p>
<p>I have to play some games (that I already won) for one more time, and a lot of games have been lost due to the crash. The positive thing is that they arranged a RAID that should prevent further problems...</p>
<p>Thanks for the good job!</p>
