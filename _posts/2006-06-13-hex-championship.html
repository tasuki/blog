<p>Yeah baby!  :thumbup1:</p>
<p>Well, I didn't exactly win, and it was only third league, but I am satisfied. I finished second in <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=hex.ch.13.3.3">hex.ch.13.3.3</a>, which means advancing to second league.</p>
<p>The <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=521216">key game</a> was against Jose Ma Grau Ribas. (in case you still don't know, in hex each player tries to connect his sides of the board – very simple) I started horribly, it almost couldn't hve been worse. I was seriously thinking about resigning around moves 12 and 20  :crying:(you can click on the numbers to see the moves). Move nr 22 was just desperate, but it somehow turned out well. Then my opponent made a serious mistake in move 31 (yah, he thought he was being clever  :smartass:), then I am happy about my move 32, although it looks stupid, it covers several threats simultaneously. I don't know when I first realised that I was going to win the game, 32 felt good but it was all unsure back then. I was sure of my win when playing 42.  8) The sequence to 59 is one of the very few totally forced sequences that there were - all leading to safe connection. Had I lost this game, I'd stay in third league, winning enabled me to advance and I also gained some cool rating points (now I have 1800, which is rather neat). Omg this was a long paragraph... I just really wonder whether anyone will actually go through the game... (as I said, <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_%28board_game%29">rules of hex are easy</a> (and it's a very cool game)).</p>
<p>One thing worth mentioning is that this championship was "consistent", eg. if you look at the <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=hex.ch.13.3.3">results</a>, you can see all the wins are above the diagonal and all the losses below it. This is probably rather rare, for example current <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=twixt.ch.12.1.1">twixt.ch.12.1.1</a> (yeah, I'm in the first league :-)) is all messed up (it's partly because of me, as I've <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=535056">beaten Klaus 'TwixT god' Hussmans</a> (it was a fast game, like most games with Klaus... but this one had different result than most  :P) as well as NieWiesz (Polish prodigy) and lost most other games against relatively weaker players (not necessarily weaker than me, but weaker than Klaus).</p>
<p>Geez, I start writing about hex championship, then longishly analyze one hex game and then switch to bragging about beating Klaus...  :|</p>
