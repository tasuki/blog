  content: You are definitely right. While we are at it... why exactly the same comment
    to the two of my posts? By the way... you probably haven't noticed that I didn't
    get rid of that rel=nofollow yet ;-)

<p>As I looked at the statistics I noticed there was quite an increase in traffic when I posted about v7ndotcom elursrebmem. Also two people I don't know posted their comments there. Seems to me that v7ndotcom elursrebmem somehow brings visitors...</p>
<p>Yeah, like this: v7ndotcom [five visitors jump in]... dramatical pause... elursrebmem! [another eight visitors rush to read my post and to possibly add their own links].</p>
<p>Also, if anyone tells me how to (easily) get rid of "rel=nofollow" in wordpress, I will (as I think it only harms people and I hate it myself when I want to spa^H^H^H comment on a blog).</p>
