<p>Okay, so I made a weblog, I am probably the last person on earth not to have done so a long time ago.</p>
<p>I noticed that I started using front page of my homepage as a blog, so I thought that maybe setting up a blog would be better...</p>
<p>And this really <strong>is</strong> my first post, the two earlier were just added afterwards with according timestamp.<br />
But I am not really sure whether it is a good idea setting up a blog just a day before an exam... And don't ask whether I prepared for it, the answer is obvious.</p>
<p>Gonna learn something, wish me good luck (err, there are no links to this blog <strong>anywhere</strong>, (hey, cool wysiwig editor), so if you read it you read it from archives and means my exam is already over (wow, that seems spooky now)).</p>
