<p>What is the meaning of life? What should one do when he loses his meaning of life? How is it possible that someone who likes you suddenly stops? Well, maybe it wasn't suddenly, but that doesn't make it any better, just the opposite. What is the correlation between love and sex? Is there any? Why are there so many questions and no answers? I feel down, I really do.</p>
