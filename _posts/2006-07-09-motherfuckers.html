<p>They got through my spam protection yet again. The bastards really pissed me off, it's of no use for them as I'm deleting their comments anyway and it only costs them bandwidth (sadly not much, and I fully realise that) and it costs <em>me</em> time (and nerves). I really don't know what to do, captcha seems to be the only viable solution...</p>
