<p>The rest of my family went on a vacation and I am staying at home with grandparents. They already managed to seriously piss me off several times.</p>
<p>I already got used to grandparents having all sorts of customs they don't want to change and I kind of understand it (like drying the dishes right after they have been washed (which makes no sense, btw)).</p>
<p>I will drive grandma to a doctor tomorrow. She desperately wanted me to go and practice the route (I refused) and she seems frightened of going by car when I drive (I drive very safely, nothing fancy). Now she told me that I don't really have to drive her there if I don't want to, that she can go by public transport (yeah, sure, with that thing she's wearing that almost disables her to move...). And she is not scared at all to send me to practice the route (and I bet it is almost sure death situation from her point of view).</p>
<p>Once during a lunch, grandpa mentioned that he had some problems solving sudoku. So I offered to help him, but he somehow didn't have time. Then the other day we talked about sudoku again and he described his strategy: "I start with certain number, for example 1, and I fill it in every box at a place it could be in. Then I proceed with another number and when it doesn't fit I just use rubber to replace the numbers." I told him that this was not a good way to solve sudoku, that he would have to have a lot of luck to solve it in a reasonable period time, that he should only fill numbers when he is completely positively sure that the number belongs where he is writing it. He responded that it was impossible to do so. I told him that I can help him and we can go through solving a sudoku together (I was still very polite then). He responded with something unclear but it was obvious he didn't want to see any more sudoku. Then he said that one day he had been solving a sudoku and he'd already got most of it right, but in the end it was impossible to fill in the middle square where the numbers just didn't fit. I am not sure whether he realised this meant that his method was wrong.</p>
<p>Grandpa also likes to explain me various things. When I was washing the dishes (and he was drying them cause it always needs to be done asap) I asked about the football championship (just cause I know that he really enjoys it, I don't give a shit about football, really)), who is winning and when the next games are scheduled. He started explaining me that now there will be semi-final, that is played by four teams, and that two of them will lose, then there will be a final, where the two winners will play for who gets the first and second place, and the losers from semifinal will play for third and fourth place. This took him several minutes... well, of course I know what knock-out tournaments look like. My grandpa just likes to explain things, he doesn't care that I know it already (I even told him once but it didn't stop him so I gave up).</p>
<p>Sigh...  :glare:</p>
