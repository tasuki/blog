<p>I've been living in this room since I was 4 years old or so (I had been in living parents' room before I think).</p>
<p>To the north there is my sister's room, to the east there is the living room, and garden is south. There is terrace above my room, and bathroom and corridor below. But what is in the west direction?</p>
<p>Just as I sit here, I have no idea what exactly there is. Well, there is neighbours' house, and I think they have a living room there, but I'm not sure. The wall is probably quite thick as I never heard any sounds from there, not even music or so.</p>
<p>And why am I writing about it? I find it rather creepy that I have no idea what is there, just one or two meters far. Do you know all the direct surroundings of the place you live in?</p>
