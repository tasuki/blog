<p>I've read somewhere that average blog lasts slightly less than three months. <strong>Now</strong> I can see why.</p>
<p>I've had the blog for about three and a half month, so I am already above average, but lately I simply do not have enough energy to write posts. It's not that there is nothing to write about, there are plenty of things I'd like to write about, but somehow it is too much work and I am very lazy.</p>
<p>So, don't expect the blog to come to the end now, but maybe I will slow down a bit...</p>
