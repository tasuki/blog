    mark on one meter long ruler – there is no such thing/time.\n\nYou can imagine
    a finite 2D space without boundaries like a sphere. We could „live in“ a very
    large 3-sphere. But I don't think today's cosmology take it as an option.\n\nMaybe

    in this debate. This despite the fact that tasuki included this very enlightening
    quote: \"extent in which objects and events occur and have relative position and
    direction\". To ask what is outside our universe is to assume the existence of
    some metauniverse in which these two could be separated. But universe is the \"entirety
    of space and time\" so how could there be a metauniverse on a higher level? \n\nIt
    can not. At least in our minds it can not. And it should not come as a surprise.
    There is no set theory in which the universe of all sets is a set. Mathematics
    can work with sets but not much with classes and the universal class is almost
    an occult subject. Physics observes and explains events in our universe but everything
    else is also just a guess and usually nonsense. Live with it. Don't think about
    something you can't think about."

  content: "I discovered your post while preparing to leave my house. It got me interested
    so I tried to hastily write something meaningful and leave on time. Needles to
    say, I failed on the second and probably on the first account too.\n\nI meant
    to say that there are some ideas that are quite common, we talk about them, but
    they don't denote any actual concept in their respective universes of discourse.
    I provided two examples – the universal class in set theory and the metauniverse
    you need for your questions in physics. To me, these are empty terms. It is, however,
    important to note that they are empty terms in a model of reality, be it physical
    reality or the 'reality' of abstract ideas. I rather like to think that this is
    the case with any questions or theories about what is outside our space or what
    had been before its beginning. Since we can think only in terms of models, I pointed
    out that all this is probably a waste of time. \n\nHowever, I wouldn't call
    all of philosophy a waste of time or \"thinking about something you can’t think
    about\". My whole argument outlined in the two posts is based on a philosophical
    stance which should probably be called platonism. Different schools of logic and
    mathematics are different based on differences in philosophical views of its advocates.
    If you held a strongly different opinion on this than me, you would find me just
    blabling incoherently. I am afraid that this might even be the case :-) But you
    necessarily must have some opinion on these matters. If you subscribe to classical
    logic and mathematics and use it to build some model, you subscribe to some philosophic
    opinion. Frightening, I know.\n\nInteresting related articles I've read recently:\n\nhttp://guidetoreality.blogspot.com/2006/12/gdels-platonism.html\nhttp://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/goldstein05/goldstein05_index.html\n\nIf
    you have time, read them. They are both about Goedel and philosophy and the first
    one is shorter."

  content: "hey Tasuki\n\nI can understand why you would be confused. A lot of
    what goes for science today is really just fantasy. Maybe I can clear it up a
    bit for you.\nFirst, space is not a thing. It's not an object. As such it does
    not exist and therefore it is neither infinite or finite. Only real objects can
    have shape and therefore size.\nLikewise, time is not a object and therfore
    it does not exist.\nOnly objects exist. It a matter of definitions. In science,
    something exist if it has shape and location. If it does not, it does not exist.\nIt
    really is amazing that so many \"scientist\" can't see this, but I'm sorry to
    say that it's true. People confuse concepts with psysical object all the time.
    Concept is defined at that wich refer to two or more objects. The concept never
    become psysically real. Even if the object it refer to exist, it still just a
    concept. Time is just an reference to movement. An easy test for finding out if
    something exist is, can you point to it or can you draw realistic picture of it.\nI
    hope i made a litte sense of it all for you.\n\nniin"

  content: "niin,\nit amazes me that you call the things you've written about science.
    Obviously, non of this questions is decidable or falsifiable (and therefore its
    not science by the very definition) and is only a matter of definitions and personal
    philosophy (eg. some people think that the world really doesn't exist and everything
    is only creation of one's mind, etc…). As for the shape and location... Tell
    me then, what is a shape and location of a photon field in quantum electrodynamics.
    Or doesn't it exist by your definition? ;-) In fact, your definition of existence
    is pretty lame even in classical physics context ;-) Only way it could stand on
    its two weak legs would be in some weird philosophical worldview, but this, again,
    is no science at all, it's more like a religion  – 'There shalt exist but things
    with shape and location and thou shalt not doubt it!' ;-)\n\ntasuki,\nas
    for the things like 13.7 billion of years… One should carefully understand what
    is meant by this. This just refers to the one of the results supported by general
    relativity. As you can see, it already assumes a philosophical worldview (a world
    can be described by physics) and further, that it is described by general relativity
    (on a larger scales we know this to be very true) so the universe's age refers
    just to the one information about spacetime (like a width, or height of an object,
    if you remember that space and time are related in relativity) which is really
    just model of the universe. And by model I mean a mathematical device that describes
    processes that can actually be measured!\n\nAs for the questions like 'What's
    outside of this universe/spacetime?' – they simply have no meaning. Why? Because
    you've already assumed you can describe the world by physics and in fact you have
    described it pretty well using the spacetime model. So questions like that really
    shouldn't be asked if you know what you're talking about. Problem is, people outside
    the physics community just like to talk about things like the age of the universe
    without really understanding the concept of physical theories behind it.\n\nTo
    sum it up, either please understand that you're using physical theories and therefore
    are not allowed to ask some stupid question or you can dispose of physics entirely
    and assume whatever worldview you like, but please make sure to not mix it up
    with any physical information like age of the universe, etc… ;-)\n\nHope
    this helps ;-)"

    you failed to provide a better one. Calling me religius is pretty funny. I don't
    believe that concepts are real like many scientists do, they are the ones that
    are religious. And so are you, if you think that concepts exist physically. \nConcepts
    are fundamentally different from objects. Concepts can't do anything. Only objects
    can do anything. In science, explanations must be buildt on objects. Any explanation
    that uses concepts to cause object to do anything is not science. If you want
    to use concept in a model, that is fine. But don't call it science.\nMany people
    confuse science with modeling. Models are frameworks that people can use as a
    shortcut to building things or making choices. Models don't explain anything,
    they are just a model. Science is about explaining things, not modeling them.\n\nScientist

  content: "Hi again niin,\nsorry if I have to get into a bit philosofical discussion
    here, I usually prefer working with a nice physical framework, but I see it is
    inevitable at this point.\nI think you have a serious problem with understanding
    very foundations of logic. As I pointed out in my previous comment, it is not
    necessary to even assume that world is described by physics. There always need
    to be some axioms, you can't prove everything, so pretty much everything boils
    down to individual religion/worldview. Therefore, there can't ever be reasonable
    _and_ unique definition of existence. Every definition depends only on the personal
    worldview.\n\n_Howerer_, if you assume the world actually _is_ described by
    physical laws (which I guess most of us intuitevely do), then your definitions
    have to be such that they match the experiments we make and theories we use to
    explain them. Therefore, your definition of existence is unphysical. I am not
    aware of any better one and I am not even sure there is need of defining it. However,
    please read on, I will elaborate more on it later on.\n\nI don't agree with
    your definition of modeling at all. Science (and as a main representative of science,
    physics) is by its very definition an attempt to explain the processes we see
    around us. The general method is:\n1. Do experiment\n2. Examine the results
    of the experimnt\n3. Create a theory/model that would explain the results (and
    of course also the previous experiments)\n4. Do more experiments to test your
    theory and its implications\n5. And so on…\n\nSo you see, all of science
    boils down to two main points: making experiments and creating theories (which
    is really just another world for a model). We won't be ever able to find out how
    nature works. We can only interpret what we see/measure. And by Heisenberg's uncertainity
    principle, measurement has it limits too. There is only so far we can go in understanding
    the nature. Therefore, there is no need to even define existence of things in
    physics. But if you really want to say something exist, you can say that objects
    in your theory exist (that is really the best we can do!).\n\nOf course, different
    sciences proceed differently, because they are usually not as fundamental as physics
    is.\n\nSigh, your last paragraph again sounds like a religous chant :-(\nAt
    least please tell me where did you learn that physics is a science of existence.
    I am a physicist myself and haven't heard this yet from any other serious physicist.
    Probably because it's a total bullshit ;-)\n\nBut I guess I am just losing
    my time here after reading your last sentence. Anyone who denies the importance
    of photon in modern physics is either a complete ignorant or a religous crackpot.
    Don't know which one is worse…\n\nMarek"

    (assumptions)\n2.\tTheory (explanations)\n3.\tConclusions (opinions)\nThere
    is more to each step, but no-where is experiments required. Fields such as archeology,

    you cant spot any errors in my logic, then you only need to prove to me that the
    photon isnt a concept and then I will change my mind. You can start by telling
    me what shape a photon has. If you cant then your belief is the same as people
    believing in god. \n\nThe basis of any religion, rest on the confusion of
    concepts with objects. Religious people think that an abstract concept is just
    as real as a living room table. Without this confusing of a concepts with reality,
    its not possible to be religious. That is why its very important that we dont

  content: "Niin,\nwhat I meant is that everyone can believe what they want. If
    they believe that they live in a matrix and all their sensory input is just a
    computer program, there is no means of ever proving them wrong (nor is there a
    need to it). This is what I meant by \"world is not necessarily described by physics\".
    That is because foundations of every worldview rest on each and every one's personal
    axioms that can't be ever proved.\n\nHowever, physics really is not about
    explaining how the world works. Only thing physics explains are the results of
    experiments. What we see and how the real world really works are very different
    things that people often confuse. There is no need for physics to explain the
    world (and as I pointed out in my previous comment, it maybe even can't ever be
    done, because of the fundamental limitations of physics on a quantum level as
    we know it today). That is why all physics does, is predict the results of the
    future experiments. Therefore, physics is actually describing the world and what
    we see and not really explaining it (although you can play with words if you will…).\n\nYour
    real method of science doesn't make much sense to me. In what part of it is experiment,
    which is the single unifying and most important point of all sciences? You can
    theorize however you want, but if your theory can't be tested with experiment,
    it's worth less than nothing. With one exception and that is mathematics, which
    doesn't need experiments, it just produces theories valid per se for use in other
    sciences (from the point of view of applied mathematics). But I assume we talk
    other sciences here and _mainly_ physics. For physics, what I've told in my last
    comment is the scientific method (experiment/theory/experiment/theory/ad infinitum…).
    If you are not a physicist, please just believe me. For other sciences, as I pointed
    out, the process is somewhat different, because it deals with less fundamental
    aspects of life, but still, the basic theory/experiment dichotomy is the same.
    If you are an archeologist and you claim that human has evolved from a bird (a
    theory) you better try to confirm it by finding bones of half human/half bird
    and other relics (experiment). There is really no other way and anyone who thinks
    he can produce theories without verifying them is not a scientist ;-)\n\nI
    don't get the difference between hypothesis and theory. In my opinion they are
    really the same thing. Both are the results of thought in an attempt to describe
    or explain something and both can't be proved, only tested for validity by experiments.
    In this view, they are the same. But maybe you have some other definitions for
    these two terms. If so, be so kind as to tell me what they are!\n\nThe basis
    of any religion is no different as basis of any other worldview! It relies on
    fundamental set of axioms that can't ever be checked. I cannot really prove the
    physics really works, or that I live in matrix, or any other scientific or religous
    worldview. All of these are equal and can't be distinguished by pure logic. They
    are just a matter of porsonal choice ;-)\n\nAnd what makes you think a living
    room table is real? You are religous in the same way other people are, you only
    choose to assume different concepts (living table here) are real. Please contemplate
    on this ;-)\n\nReligous doesn't mean wrong. You clearly don't understand logic,
    axioms, deduction and other important concepts, to understand that religion is
    no different from any other worldview. The only difference is that you really
    can't mix different worldviews together, much as you can't mix some mathematical
    theories because you can get to a contradiction. That is why scientific people
    frown down on religion (you can't really believe in a god, when you have already
    classified all forms of matter and pretty much described the world around yourself
    and didn't find any real need for god). But it's really the same from the other
    way around. If you are religous, you can frown down on scientific people. But
    both groups are absolutely equal. It is just important not to mix the two together
    ;-)\n\nYou want me to tell you the shape of the photon and then point out
    that if I can't my belief is the same as those of religous people. It exactly
    is! Finally you maybe start to undarstand, that to believe in existence of physical
    theories that describe the world is the very same thing as to believe in god.
    I know this very well and am not ashamed by this in view of what I've written
    up to now ;-)\n\nIn the end, it seems to me that you are a philosopher with
    fixed worldview and strict definitions of every term which aren't really able
    to encompass all of different uses of those terms in science. Please try to contemplate
    a bit on what I've written. I think I don't have anything else to add. If you
    still disagree with me, try to point out where my logic fails, I tried to be as
    clear as I could.\n\nMarek"

    your models a little better, you could call them science inspired models, but
    don't call them science. Because that would be misleading. You said yourself that
    you didn't care about truth but only about describing things.\n\nOne of the
    benefits of not ascribing to the experiment definition of science is that you
    don't have to believe in anything to say that something exists. In science we
    start out by defining words in the hypothesis stage. So if we have a definition
    of an object, then we only need to see if the object's characteristics match the
    definitions. If it does, then it exists by definition.\nI can see a table in
    my living room, it has shape, it has location, it matches the definition of a
    table, and therefore the table exists. There is no need to experiment, no need
    to believe. The table exists even if I don’t observe it. There is no need to invoke
    belief in science.\n\nI'm glad that you admit that your photon model is just
    as valid as the belief that Jesus walked on water and roused from the dead. It
    makes it easy to judge how valid it is. I think ill rank it below belief in Santa
    Claus. At least you could draw a picture of him.  ^_^\n\nniin"

  content: "Dear niin,\nI certainly don't use senses to argue about things. I use
    my brain. I encourage you to do the same, it would really help this discussion
    ;-)\n\nBut I don't believe this conversation is leading anywhere. I really
    have no business talking with someone who is saying that physics is not science.
    Also, I am not sure you have seriously thought about anything I've written and
    you just aren't able to use logic correctly as I see it.\n\nRegarding the
    photon, you didn't get it at all, did you? All I said is that I believe in physical
    framework. If so do you (and I will assume you believe physics works) you are
    mocking yourself also.\nVery well then, I will explain photon to you. You see,
    in modern physics, there is a thing called quantum theory. It can be shown, that
    objects don't have a clearly defined position (as it can be measured). All we
    can get from quantum theory are the probabilities of measuring some variable.
    Therefore, from the point of quantum theory there is no such thing as shape. That
    would only be a classical idea which is why I made fun of you in the first place,
    because your definitions clearly come from the place that has no real touch with
    physics. It turns out, in quantum theory, all things are like this, only when
    they get bigger, the probabilities go higher to find the object at one certain
    place as opposed to it being spread over a region. Therefore you can define your
    shape here. However, there is no distinction between \"things with shape\" and
    \"things without shape\" in quantum theory. They are treated on equal footing.
    Also, ordinary matter is composed out of atoms. I hope you know at least that
    much. Atoms are composed out of nucleons and electrons. Those are particles of
    matters. However, there are also particles of field tying them together present
    (photon, gluon, W+/W-/Z bosons) which are again treated on equal footing with
    matter particles like electron or quarks. Therefore, if you at least believe in
    atomic hypothesis and quantum theory as any sane man would do, then you have to
    admit photon is just as real as any dining table. However, by your definition,
    photon doesn't exist because it has no shape. Oh my, we have arrived at contradiction,
    and all because of your lousy definition. Why oh why is it so? ;-)\n\nMarek"

<p>I remember thinking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space">space</a> (as in "three-dimensional extent in which objects and events occur and have relative position and direction") when I was a little kid. I asked my dad what was outside of the universe and he told me that we do not know for sure but most probably there isn't <em>anything</em>. I couldn't quite understand what he meant by that, so I asked him, and he continued to explain that there simply is no space. I couldn't grasp that either, so I imagined that there is a <em>very hard rock</em> – so hard that nothing else can fit in there, and hence there is no space.</p>
<p>I grew older and abandoned the very-hard-rock theory. But I haven't found a reasonable substitute for it. And it bothers me. A lot.</p>
<p>There simply is no reasonable possibility for space to even exist:</p>
<ol>
<li>Space is infinite and extends everywhere and never ends. I think I do not even need to explain why this sounds stupid.</li>
<li>Space is finite. Then what is outside of it? There is no space outside. Then there is no outside. Unreasonable, too.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that I am talking about space, not necessarily in connection with the universe. Just the concept of space and its infinity/finity confuses the hell out of me. And it makes me scared.</p>
<p>It's similar with time. According to wikipedia, universe is the "entirety of space and time". So, if I understand it correctly, there was no time before universe. And the universe is approximately 13.73 billion years old. Which means that 14 billion years ago, there was no time. Wait, what?</p>
