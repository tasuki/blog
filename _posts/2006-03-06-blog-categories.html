<p>Making a blog? Or just thinking about making one?</p>
<p>If you do not belong to the 80% of people who give up after three months anyway, let me give you this advice: think up the categories before actually starting posting (or do not forget to add a new category each time you post something that needs a separate category). I made a huge mistake of making just very few (and silly) categories. Recategorizing all the posts took quite some time and it could have been easily avoided.</p>
