<p>I've just returned from <a  href="http://lsg.go.art.pl/">LSG</a>, saying it was great would be an underestimation. If I have to decide between LSG and EGC I definitely choose LSG.</p>
<p>Przystanek Alaska is great, the lake is great, weather was great, beer was great, parties were great, but most of all – the people were great.<br />
Thanks to everyone – kabu, lapkom, suska, ajka, comboy, sosna, martyna, basia & tomasz mroczek, nexo, hitech, fetkaa, rams, wieczorniczek, dominika (dorota), piotrek, ela, przemas, emtom, lobo, iskierka, yapee, sh, yebi, soui, sad, kamyszyn, radziol, kamyk, seok-bin, tommell, gertzu, quasigoose, azael, myszcz, przemek and everyone else that I can't remember now because it is too late and I'm tired).</p>
<p>But my most <em>special</em> thanks go to: benerit, juggler, grasiu, vertigo, method, anka, ola, fisz, cichaczem, and last but not least - kotasia (if she hadn't told me I wouldn't have even gone there).</p>
