<p>I started with <a  href="http://avidemux.org/">avidemux</a>, which is capable of handling <strong>lots</strong> of formats. I'd call it a low level editor, it gives you power over many very basical things (such as <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_format">containers</a>, <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_codec">codecs</a> and their settings (there are <strong>many</strong> settings)). It allows you to do some basic operations (but you have to be careful not to cut of the keyframes (or I-frames or whatever you like to call them), or transfer the whole video into something containing only I-frames if you want to edit it) but no effects and such.</p>
<p>Then I tried to install cinelerra, but I disliked at the first sight &nbsp; it is way too complex (at least for me, I am not going to spend the rest of my life learning how to manage a video editing program). In the near future I am going to try out <a  href="http://www.diva-project.org/">diva</a> and/or <a  href="http://jahshaka.org/">jahshaka</a>. Diva seems really nice & easy, but jahshaka too. So I don't know where to start... any suggestions?</p>
