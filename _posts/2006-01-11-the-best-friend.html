<p>The title is just made up, it was someone I considered my second best friend.</p>
<p>When my then-gf broke up with me, he helped me a lot. He talked with me and explained me various things to make it easier for me. He also once said that he wouldn't start going out with her, that he would never do that to me. Well, <em>I</em> didn't ask for it.</p>
<p>The rest is obvious.</p>
<p>The lesson? Simple: don't believe everything people say, it might be just empty phrases...</p>
