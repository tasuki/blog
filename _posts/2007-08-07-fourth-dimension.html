This post is not about math, it is about how I perceive the world.
</p>
<p>
I know, fourth dimension is easy, for example you can easily create vector v=(1, 2, 3, 4) … but somehow, this is just numbers and tricks, I can’t really <em>feel</em> the fourth dimension. I recently had some free time to think about random stuff, and, well, I thought about this:
</p>
<p>
Let’s start with: 1 = x² + y². As we all know, this equation draws a <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle">circle</a>.
</p>
<p>
The next step consists of substituting the one for another variable: z = x² + y². Now we get one more dimension. Although it might not be completely clear on the first sight, this is <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraboloid">paraboloid</a>. If we assume <em>z</em> is a variable that we can set to anything we want, different values of <em>z</em> create different circles (<em>z</em> is the height at which we cut the paraboloid to get that particular circle).
</p>
<p>
We had a circle already, so let’s bring the circle to the third dimension and make a <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere">sphere</a>: 1 = x² + y² + z²
</p>
<p>
Now, what do we get when we make the transformation we made in the first step – substituting the one for yet another variable?
</p>
<p>
w = x² + y² + z²
</p>
<p>
I don’t know about you, but I can finally feel the fourth dimension within my reach. ;-)
</p>
<p>
While I don’t know what exactly this “w = x² + y² + z²” looks like (neither know what it is called, for that matter), I can see that there is precisly the same relation – the same way circle is one “slice” of paraboloid, sphere is one “slice” of w = x² + y² + z² (for some concrete set value of <em>w</em>).
