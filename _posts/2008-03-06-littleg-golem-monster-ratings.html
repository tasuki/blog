<p>I've always wanted to see how succesful players on littlegolem are in overall.</p>
<p>So after waiting a year or two, I decided to create it myself...</p>
<p>And thus (haha, "thus" is such a lame word) <a href="http://golem.tasuki.org/">Little Golem Monster Ratings</a> were born. There's a <a href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/forum/topic2.jsp?forum=1&topic=1825">thread</a> on littlegolem where Monster ratings are being discussed -- feel free to join.</p>
<p>I feel that I should write something more and/or something more interesting, but I'm just too tired at the moment...</p>
<p>PS: I am currently fourth in the overall ratings, which is not too bad. But I'll start playing more games to hopefully improve my position. :)</p>
