<p><img align="left" style="margin-right: 5px" src="/assets/2007/carving.jpg" />I've just spent a wonderful week in <a  href="http://www.risoul.com/">Risoul</a> (their web sucks big time, but I feel compelled to link it anyway).</p>
<p>It was a great trip, the weather was nice (mostly sunny but some clouds too, which was good because the snow usully kept bellow zero even in the afternoon).</p>
<p>Out of the six days of skiing, I fell three times:</p>
<p>The first one was classical – I was trying to do a left turn, but my left ski got stuck in a pile of snow. Subsequently, the binding let go and I fell in a  magnificent way, providing entertainment for the few onlookers.</p>
<p>The second one was just plain stupid and boring. I was trying to brake by making a 180˚ turn at a very low speed (always a bad idea). Of course the heavy snow layer was a bit thicker than I expected, so I fell over.</p>
<p>The third one was nasty, I was just practicing carving skiing and was inspecting my last carved turn (carving turns usually throw you out at a fairly high speed). It was in the morning, the pistes were groomed and there weren't many people. I thought it was all clear and easy, but apparently I missed the fact that the piste was going quite a bit uphill. As I approached this uphill at a fairly high speed and completely unaware, it cought me by surprise and threw me on my back. I managed to stand up without losing much speed, but after stopping, I noticed that my right thumb was really hurting.</p>
<p>After that, the thumb was growing for about an hour. It grew so much that removing my glove showed impossible (in the evening I somehow managed, but it took a lot of effort and it was rather painful). Now (after more than three days), I can move my thumb and use it for simple tasks that do not require much power.</p>
<p>I spent the first three days skiing the boring same style I've practiced for all my life. It's quite elegant, but not quite as enjoyable. I just go down the hill, letting the ski slip vertically. I think I got quite good at it, but it requires quite a steep slope to reach a good speed, and I was always really bored on the less steep pistes, waiting for a place to gain some speed.</p>
<p>Carving style, on the other hand, is much more dynamical. You retain your speed, because by doing the turn using the edge of the ski, you effectively avoid skidding.</p>
<p>So I spent the other three days trying to learn carve turns and I think I succeeded. Because of the hurt thumb, I got rid of the poles and I found out that they were in fact quite useless.</p>
<p>Mhmm, this post is getting quite long, so I'd better stop it soon... anyways, if you have read this far – have a look at my <a  href="http://photo.tasuki.org/risoul2007/">photo gallery from Risoul</a>!</p>
