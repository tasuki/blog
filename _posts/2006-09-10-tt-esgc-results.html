<p>Okay, this will be boring:</p>
<p>First there was Toyota Tour in Brno, where I scored 3/6 but only lost to 6dan players (and two of the games already looked rather good for me...), somehow ended up winning "best 4dan".</p>
<p>After one day break there was ESGC (European Students' Go Championship), a six round tournament where I started pretty well winning first four games (the only notable win is against Antoine Fenech, but I am not sure whether the game is notable too). After this, there were only two of us with four wins, but ex-insei Pal Balogh crushed me in his favourite moyo style game. In the last round I played Merlijn Kuin, it was basically a game for the second place (which means going to Japan). The game started by Merlijn making a mistake followed by about three of my mistakes. After having played endgame in the fuseki in such an important game I was angry with myself and started some wild invading. The group got quite big and it could have lived easily in many ways but I somehow managed to die. Painful...</p>
