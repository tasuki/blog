<p>Friday: I couldn't sleep well, sweating and waking up all the time. In the morning I didn't feel any better plus I had a horrible headache. After measuring my temperature and finding out it was slightly over 38˚C, I knew I had a problem. A big problem.</p>
<p>Decisions, decisions… First thing, I'm not going to go to work, that is completely out of question with my head spinning at about 180 rotations per minute. The big decision was whether to take vacations or become officially ill. If I became officially ill, I obviously couldn't go to France in the afternoon. So I decided to risk it, called my boss, explained the situation and asked him whether I could take Friday off. He wasn't too happy but he actually didn't have much of a choice...</p>
<p>Then I slept for few hours and after that went to visit the doctor. After explaining my symptoms, I got the expected "no way you are leaving anywhere today" response. I let her know that I'd really really like to go there, and after some tests (urine, blood, etc.), none of which ended up well, she concluded that maybe I could try it.</p>
<p>Off to buy Paralen and Smecta. Temperature jumping back and forth between 37 and 38˚C. Funny how it was completely in sync with my headache.</p>
<p>After getting diarrhoea, drinking smecta (I bet I could get some clay way cheaper than this) and sleeping through the whole afternoon, I was facing a decision: should I stay home, get healthy in three days and regret it for the rest of the week, or should I leave and die far from home? Opposed to advice from almost everyone, I decided to leave.</p>
<p>Those 24 hours in the bus weren't so bad, I just kind of sat there and waited. Both high temperature and headache were practically gone, all I was left with was a diarrhoea. And smecta for the rescue (it really tastes like mud). I think I ate about one roll during the journey.</p>
<p>We arrived at Tignes a bit earlier than planned, so we had some time to just enjoy the sunny weather and look around the town/village.</p>
<p>Sunday morning was rather sunny. There were ~30 centimeters of fresh snow, which was, uh oh… very nice... at least for those who were able to ski in it somehow. As for me, I never was any good at skiing in deep snow. I think I fell about 4 times. Moreover, stale rolls + smecta did not exactly give me much strength to fight all that snow. Luckily, the weather got substantially worse in the afternoon, so I just stayed home and slept through it all.</p>
<p>I don't remember much of Monday, except stale rolls, smecta, and bad weather. I slept through the morning and only went skiing in the afternoon, but I don't recall the details too well.</p>
<p>Tuesday was the turning point: The diarrhoea stopped (well, almost), I tried some new food like rice and even had two squares of chocolate. Weather was perfect, there was no new snow (ie. the pistes were groomed) so we went exploring the surroundings.</p>
<p>You might want to <a href="http://www.tignes.net/GB_plan-pistes.html">consult the map</a>, as I'm going to present some otherwise rather boring names:</p>
<p>After skiing on Tichot for over an hour, while my sister was getting her snowboard repaired, we went up from Val Claret through Tichot and Col du Palet to L'Aiguille Percee (2748), then went through Sache piste all the way down to Tignes les Brevieres (1550). Over 1km vertically down in one go. It was very nice and there was plenty of nature around, so we had a nice lunch in the forest. Then we returned to Tignes 2100. As there was still a lot of time left till the evening, we went over Toviere (2704) down to La Daille (1785) and then by "funiculaire" up to Rocher de Bellevarde (2827).</p>
<p>Wednesday was also great. The weather was excellent, so we headed straight over Col de Fresse and Rocher de Bellevarde to Val d'Isere (1850). Then up to Solaise (2560) and down to Le Laisinant. From there to the fifth (!) and (as we thought) last valley. There we went down to Le Fornet (1930) where we had lunch (mmm, cheese). "Signal" was possibly the steepest red slope I've ever seen. We were rather surprised that Glacier de Pissaillas and the slopes on it were in yet another valley, it certainly didn't look so on the map. And boy it was cold in there. So, after going Cascades once, we headed back using Leissieres Express, which is a silly chairlift that takes you up on one side of the hill and down on the other. Alas, it was the only way to get back. We returned in basically the same way from here (Solaise, Val d'Isere, Rocher de Bellevarde, Col de Fresse). As there was still some time left, we went to funiculaire Grande Motte, and then to the huge cabin (they call it "cable car" in English, but I don't think that describes it well, "fucking huge cabine" describes it much better, imho). At 3456m, this was the highest point we reached in Tignes.</p>
<p>The weather worsened significantly on Thursday. We spent the morning on Lanches, with the occasional funiculaire not to get bored. As the weather was so-so, we lunched back in our appartment. After the lunch we went to Tignes 2100, where we spent the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Friday morning, clouds and fog everywhere. Plus 20cm of fresh snow and still snowing. First few rides were an ordeal, I tried skiing the way I'm used to (long turns accross the whole piste, mostly carving, sliding slightly on steep slopes to keep the speed under control). After getting no answer from my dad, I watched others and noticed most of the people who seemed in control of the situation were doing very short turns. I think it almost trippled my speed when I discovered (almost simultaneously) two very important things about skiing in deep snow:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is vital to only have your weight on one leg at a time (I used to be very precise about this, but with carving I kind of forgot, since there it is not very important). If possible, try to have the other leg high enough not to get it stuck somewhere.</li>
<li>To greatly increase your stability, you should try to move your body in a constant direction at a constant speed. Make extremely short "turns" just with your legs. These slow you down considerably, while constant direction and constant speed of your body provide perfect stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually I didn't fall at all on Friday, which is very good considering the zero visibility and huge amounts of snow (which got irregularly scattered during the day). There were many (dozens) cases where I almost fell down, but always somehow miraculously prevailed.</p>
<p>We spent the afternoon on Bollin and Tichot, as all the other lifts were closed.</p>
<p>The journey back home took a bit longer (slightly over 24 hours) as we got stuck in a traffic jam, but otherwise it went ok.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a great week, I further improved my carving skillz, and I finally learned to ski in deep snow. :-)</p>
