  content: "IntelliJ IDEA: rightclick on tab with file -&gt; split horizontally/vertically,
    but I guess this feature is there for ages and IDEA wont be the only normal IDE
    that can do this. Updating all views on-the-fly is by default. \r\n\r\nOn the
    other hand - IDEA has a vim plugin that allows you using more less all vim features
    in IDEA. Does your vim-thing have IDEA plugin? :)"

  content: "Oooh, I stand corrected then. But why do people never use it?\r\n\r\nMy
    vim-thing has no IDEA ;) \r\nCan the IDEA plugin do <code>inoremap jk &lt;esc&gt;</code>
    ?"

<p>No place to be humble, I'm a vim power user.</p>
<p>Yes, your IDE can do things my vim can't. But my vim can do things your IDE can't. How many times have I watched someone using an IDE and thought "if only it were vim I'd take your keyboard and solve this in about two seconds, while you click around and keep getting lost".</p>
<p>My favourite vim feature? <strong>Displaying different parts of one buffer (ie file) in two vertically split windows.</strong> Can <em>your IDE</em> do that? Now get off my lawn!</p>
<p>Open a file, split vertically, scroll each of the split windows independently:<br />
<code><br />
$ vim ~/.bashrc<br />
:vs<br />
G<br />
</code></p>
