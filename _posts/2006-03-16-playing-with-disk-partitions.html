  content: Jojo, mám zkušenosti s několika GNU/Linuxovými nástroji, že měnit velikost
    paritions jde jenom u FAT32 a NTFS. Cože je divný... Asi to nějak jde ale zas
    tak do hloubky jsem nešel.

<p>Yesterday I decided to quadruple my swap (from 256mb to 1gb) so that I can play more hands in poker before having to restart the application that continually eats more and more of my memory.</p>
<p>Firstly I cut off that 1gb out of my fat32 data partition, that went relatively easy with me only having to umount all the partitions around and that was basically all.</p>
<p>Then I destroyed the former swap, which is after my ext3 linux partition and before fat32 data one. I thought it would be neat to add these 256mb to my ext3 (yeah, I still have 40gb hdd which has been completely full for a very long time) but that obviously wasn't possible as there is root mounted and I couldn't umount it. So I tried to run a live cd and thought all would be ok, but for some reason qtparted doesn't want to enlarge that ext3. :-(<br />
Sorry for boring geekish post...</p>
