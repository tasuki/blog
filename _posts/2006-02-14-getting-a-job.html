After the lunch I sat down and wrote a short CV, I sent it somewhere prepared to wait for the ten days after which no response means rejection. What a surprise when an hour later my cell phone rang (wtf? someone calling me on my cell phone? that hasn’t happened for ages…). I got asked several questions and the woman even tested my l33t 3ngli5h skillz. After rather longish talk she told me to turn up for an interview on wednesday… okay, nothing to lose, I will try :)

Now one thing that puzzled me a bit – I got asked what wage I’d expect… Well, to be sincere I have no expectations, but as her job is to make my wage as low as possible, I am going to try to make it a bit harder for her :)
