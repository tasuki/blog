<p>I have to deal with unreasonable KGS users all day long. They argue about totally insane things ad infinitum. I try to be patient and understanding, as far as it's possible. I am even trying to be nice to people who complain about escapers.</p>
<p>I got used to KGS users being unreasonable, but I at least expected a bit reasonable behaviour from admins.</p>
<blockquote><p>tasuki: if I say pretty please, will you move "Photography" room to social? (yes, I know I own way too many rooms, but there's no photography-related room on KGS and I think it's a pity)<br />
anonymousadmin: ok, what other accounts do you have?<br />
anonymousadmin: ... gotta put you through the hoops<br />
anonymousadmin: yikes... tasuki owns several rooms!<br />
anonymousadmin: how did you get allowed so many??
</p></blockquote>
<p>Haha, good one (you know, admins like to tease each other a little bit). After some more discussion, I check the room and it's still in "New rooms". Well, turns out this wasn't a joke after all.</p>
<p>To explain what's going on: there are various arbitrary rules on KGS. My theory about these rules is that whoever invented them thought "our admins are pretty dumb so I have to create very concrete rules for the admins to be able to follow them and not to have to apply their common sense". Unfortunately, the inventor probably wasn't much mistaken.</p>
<p>One such rule is that for a room to be moved from "New" category to any other, it must have a description and the owner must not own any other rooms. Nice rule. Except that you can circumvent it by finding someone who has no room yet to create this one for you. Or you can simply stop being owner of your other rooms and only own this one.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, these rules are being misused. For example, this particular rule was obviously designed to prevent certain individuals from creating many meaningless rooms. It was not created to prevent someone from creating a perfectly valid and useful room about something many people are actually interested in. But "we have to follow the rules". Oh btw, the admin in question also owns several rooms. So sue me.</p>
<p>PS: Take this as an invitation to join the "Photography" room, under Social. :-)</p>
