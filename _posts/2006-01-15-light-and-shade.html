<p>I recently got Mike Oldfield's "new" album â€“ Light and Shade. I can't help but to listen to it over and over. The tracks that I like most after first few listenings are: Angelique, Slipstream, Surfing (which is really weird and I do not know what I like about it most, but it just decided to repeat in my head all the time, maybe it is because of that mood I have been having lately), Tears of an Angel, Ringscape and Nightshade.</p>
<p>Well, now that I think of it I definitely prefer the Shade part over Light (except of Angelique, that is).</p>
<p>Post edited: And I love Quicksilver. As Mike said - it is not a dance music, it is just music with a dance rhythm.</p>
