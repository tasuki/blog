<blockquote>When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful,<br />
a miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical.<br />
And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily,<br />
joyfully, playfully watching me.<br />
But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible,<br />
logical, responsible, practical.<br />
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable,<br />
clinical, intellectual, cynical.</p>
<p>There are times when all the world's asleep,<br />
the questions run too deep<br />
for such a simple man.<br />
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned<br />
I know it sounds absurd<br />
but please tell me who I am.</p>
<p>Now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical,<br />
liberal, fanatical, criminal.<br />
Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're<br />
acceptable, respecable, presentable, a vegtable!</p></blockquote>
<p>I found this song in a similar way as many other good songs â€“ by listening to a radio and looking for original versions of various shitty remakes (yeah, remakes are always shitty, but the Scooter's remake of The Logical Song was kind of funny and I liked it as well). I like the text but I'm not really sure about the vegetable part (which is spelled as "vegtable" in some versions of the lyrics and as "vegetable" in others), is it there just for the rhyme or is there a hidden meaning? (the hidden meaning might actually be that it is there just to rhyme, if you understand what I mean)</p>
