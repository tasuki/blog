<p>A <a href="/wp-content/uploads/aga.jpg">friend</a> of mine had this in her user info on <a  href="http://kgs.kiseido.com">KGS</a>:</p>
<p>"...Here I am, once again<br />
Iâ€™m torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't  pretend<br />
Just thought you were the one<br />
Broken up, deep inside<br />
But you won't get to see the tears I cry..."</p>
<p>Now the human part of me feels sorry for her and the geeky part wonders how much time average person spends feeling like this (of course there is length and intensity, and it is also very subjective, which makes it difficult to measure).</p>
<p>Anyway, when you feel really bad then any change is for better and vice versa, it just tends to balance (and if it doesn't then there is something wrong with you ;-)). Being inone extreme for longer period can throw you into the other extreme surprisingly easily (works both ways).<br />
Do you think I should become a psychologist? (...) Uhm, yeah, I do not think so either...</p>
