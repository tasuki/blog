<p>Someone is clicking my ads like crazy. <strong>Don't fucking do it!!!</strong></p>
<p>If they close my account I am gonna find out who it was and kill ya. No joking.</p>
<p>I will have access to the stats after midnight and I am almost sure I will find out who it was (as there are almost no visitors), then... beware!</p>
<p>Well, now that I calmed down a bit - got 1 visitor who clicked 3 times on one page and 2 times on the other one, that is like, uhm... not really good.</p>
<p>Shit, if they close my account (and I wouldn't be that surprised if they did) I am really going to kill you...</p>
<p>Aaaaaaaaargh..........</p>
