<p>Yay! Today when I woke up I saw a new message on littlegolem - <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=dots.ch.6.3.4">dots.ch.6.3.4</a> finished. And to my surprise I finished second, which means advancing to 7.2.x, that's pretty neat considering my poor knowledge of this wonderful game.</p>
<p>As a side note, I am not sure whether I explained clearly what all the numbers mean, but it is indeed very simple - game . tournament_type . x-th tournament . league . group</p>
<p>Well, if that still isn't clear dots.ch.6.3.4 is dots championship, sixth one, third league, fourth group of the third league (there is one group in the first league, two in second league, four in third league, eight in fourth league, etc., you get the idea :))</p>
