  content: Well, you see... Brno is relatively small so it's not <i>that</i> difficult
    (my work is something over 2km, train station about 3km). That said, when I was
    in Warsaw I of course walked from the train station to v's place :-) (I hope you
    are who I think you are, cause otherwise this will be rather impossible to understand)

  content: Rather awesome thing :). Though in place where I live I also don't use
    public transport and walk/bike all the time with one exception which is going
    to work (12km is really not a distance I would like to walk :D). And when I was
    in Brno because of teeth or Invex I always used to walk to the site from train/bus
    .. it is refreshing, gives time to think and is easy on ones budget (being a student
    can be really bad at times).

  content: "szeery: good points...\r\n\r\nThere's only one you forgot -- it makes
    you remember the way. When I drive somewhere 5 times I can still forget where
    to take the turn and often I'm not exactly sure where I am etc. When I walk somewhere
    just two times (there and back), I'll remember it forever and won't get lost the
    next time."

<p>Yay, I made it -- one year without using Brno public transport. I walked, walked, walked and walked. Sometimes I used my bike when it was too far and when the weather was suitable. I only used car when it was because of someone else (such as driving my grandaunt to her home or similar occasions).</p>
<p>I had used public transport at Brno tournament one year ago, and now I had to do the same because the tournament site is too far to walk to and I couldn't go by bike as I was going with my Polisz friends. The tournament was a minor disaster for me, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. Especially the moments not spent playing go.</p>
<p>While I'm not planning to break any more records as far as public transport is concerned, I still plan on trying to actively avoid using it. <a href="/walking-as-a-means-of-transport/">Walking is good.</a></p>
<p>And yes, j'aime fran√ßais, why are you asking?</p>
