Yesterday I was talking with myszcz (it’s not important what we were actually talking about… or… maybe you don’t even want to know…). He sometimes uses very zen-like sentences, but this was probably the best one:

Myszcz: maybe I’ll go to sleep, and after sleeping my mind will have the answer
</p>
</blockquote>

But myszcz denied being a zen monk, he even said he didn’t know anything about zen (like I believe him, haha).
