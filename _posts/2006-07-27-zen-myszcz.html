<p>Yesterday I was talking with myszcz (it's not important what we were actually talking about... or... maybe you don't even want to know...). He sometimes uses very zen-like sentences, but this was probably the best one:</p>
<blockquote><p>Myszcz: maybe I'll go to sleep, and after sleeping my mind will have the answer</p></blockquote>
<p>But myszcz denied being a zen monk, he even said he didn't know anything about zen (like I believe him, haha).</p>
