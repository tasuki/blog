<p>When I was returning from the Mikulov tournament, I followed a bike path for last fifth of my travel. The path is about 3 meters wide and made of asphalt.</p>
<p>It was sunday afternoon, so the path was crowded. There were basically three types of people â€“ walkers, roller-skaters and bikers. Bikers moving around 20-30km/h, roller-skaters 10-20km/h, and walkers 0-5km/h. The path is wide enough for 4 walkers next to each other, for 3 bikers and for 2 roller-skaters. It is used in both directions simultaneously, I guess that you can imagine the mess.</p>
<p>The worst were roller-skaters, who really like to ride in pairs next to each other, one taking up half of the path, so there's no space left for anyone else. The only positive thing about them was that 80% of roller-skating girls are really pretty (I don't know whether it's the cause or the effect). On the other hand that makes it even more difficult to concentrate on manoeuvering through the crowds...</p>
