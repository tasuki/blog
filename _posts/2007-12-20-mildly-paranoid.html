  content: I guess it's kinda natural for some people to be more aware of their surroundings
    (let's not go into IQ again). I made a habit of blowing into glasses and cups
    I'm about to use. It's a good way to tell if they're clean or if your dad did
    the washing up last time and if there's no dust or insects in it. Prolly there's
    some other stuff but it's so 2nd nature that I don't even know atm.

  content: Bunch of psychos, all of you. Blowing in glasses, WTF. Damn, my IQ must
    be extremely low (thankfully it's no measure of intelligence at all ;) ).

    to hide the referer info from the server (usually when searching for people and
    not wanting them to know someone with my ip googled them). :)\n\nignus: what's
    the measure of intelligence, then? (I always thought intelligence was defined
    as \"ability to solve iq tests\" ;-))"

  content: "Here goes (this will probably be a vague and rambling text…)\n\nIf
    that's how you define \"intelligence\", that's of course fine.\n\nI think
    that the way in which we use the word \"intelligence\" in daily life, does not
    encompass solely the ability of solving IQ tests. I think it is a much broader
    concept. An artist, an orchestra director and a programmer of roguelike games
    could be called \"intelligent\" for radically different reasons (none of which
    presumably has anything to do with solving IQ tests).\n\nOf course the way
    in which we name things in daily life does not prove that these things actually
    are in this way. However, the word \"intelligence\" is, I think, a \"shortcut\"
    for a plethora of very different things. This makes it hard to abstract from the
    way in which it is used in natural language.\n\nI'm not saying IQ tests are
    nonsense, or that they don't measure anything – they just don't measure all that
    there is to be measured when it comes to \"intelligence\". IQ may be important,
    but it's just one of the many aspects of \"intelligence\". Moreover, I think there
    are aspects of \"intelligence\" which are unmeasurable. \n\nYou can of course
    let go of it's prima-facie meaning and narrow it down with an exact definition.
    This is perfectly fine, but the question remains if the picture you are painting
    is all there is to it.\n\nI have written about this in an much earlier post
    of yours on this blog as well, I believe."

<p>I'm mildly paranoid – and fully aware of it.</p>
<p>For example, when leaving a windowless room with the lightswitch inside (typically a bathroom) and entering a lighted corridor/passage/room/whatever I always switch the light off <em>before</em> opening the door. Why? Well, if there was anyone out there out to get me, this could give me a considerable edge. First, I wouldn't be occupied with switching the light off, and more importantly, you always want to be in the dark with the other person out there in the lighted area.</p>
<p>I'm also slightly paranoid in other ways, but it's not as funny as the above example and I don't want to tell because you guys would abuse the knowledge to poke fun at me. ;-)</p>
