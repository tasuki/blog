<p>How do small children learn their mother tongue? They can use no dictionaries, no handbooks, noone can explain them, simply because they don't know <strong>any</strong> language yet. They learn by listening and imitating.</p>
<p>That's the approach I decided to use too. I've been reading Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien (thanks to Drc for lending me) and I haven't used a dictionary although there are plenty of words I don't understand. When I get to such a word, I try to guess its meaning, on the next occurence, it gets more accurate, when I see the word ten times in different sentences I usually understand pretty well what it means. I think this approach is generally slower than using a dictionary, but it offers much deeper understanding. Although, I have to admit, there are some <a  href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/">dictionaries, that are pretty good</a>.</p>
<p>As my random thoughts go, I usually skip between various things when writing a post:<br />
I find extensive use of the word "cry" meaning "shout" quite funny. I was taught that crying is the process of making tears, so, when I read "blah blah blah, cried Gandalf", it always confuses me. Is it used like that in contemporary english?</p>
