<p>I stumbled upon a <a  href="http://www.typingtest.com/">typing test</a>. I chose "Fishing in Finland" and measuring in CPM (characters per minute, as opposed to WPM - words per minute, which is pretty useless). And my first result was 250 - hazah. That makes slightly more than 4 keystrokes per second, which is not bad, considering the fact that I spent quite a lot of the time looking at the screen and reading (when I want to type as fast as possible I have to look at the keyboard), also the word "eutrophication" took several seconds for me to grasp. On next rounds I achieved higher score, but I guess that doesn't really count when you know the text already.</p>
<p>Then I tried just writing something from my mind (eg. I didn't look at the screen at all) and I wrote 90 characters in 15 seconds (tried it several times with similar results), which makes cca 6 keystrokes per second (if I understand it correctly, that is roughly equal to 60 wpm).</p>
<p>According to wikipedia, there's a woman who is about <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter#Typing_speed_records_and_speed_contests">three times faster than me</a>. Twice faster would be still at least imaginable, but three times faster than <em>me</em>? Come on... I am not <em>that</em> slow... or am I?</p>
