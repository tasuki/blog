<p>Colors are often neglected or people even choose as shiny colors as possible. It hurts eyes and makes any text unreadable. All people working with colors should at least read <a  href="http://www.worqx.com/color/">color theory overwiew</a>. I wonder why they never taught us this in school.</p>
<p>If you are seeking good color combinations then visit <a  href="http://www.colorcombos.com/">color combos</a>, with hundreds of color combinations prepared for you to use. A lot of them are rather crappy but if you look around a bit you can find some really wonderful ones.</p>
<p>[Edit 2018] There are now nicer tools for <a href="https://www.canva.com/colors/">choosing colors</a>. They also help with <a href="https://www.canva.com/colors/combinations/">color combinations</a>!</p>
