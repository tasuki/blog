<p>As I was in a train heading to Poland there was rather largish group of young people. At one station they got out, but one girl somehow (dunno why & how) got stuck inside. As the train began to accelerate, she has gone totally crazy, shouting and screaming. Then somehow conductor entered the scene, being the ideal target of the mad girl. He was trying to explain her that he really can't stop the whole train just because she didn't get out in time (the train was accelerating all the time), but she was really maniacal, calling him names, explaining that she left the rest of her group who are waiting for another train that will leave in 15 minutes, etc. In the end, to the great surprise of all the other people, the train began to slow down... So, if you ever get into similar situation, just pretend you've gone crazy :-)</p>
<p>PS: Uhm, yeah, I know I often tell people not to write everything into one paragraph...</p>
<p>PPS: The timestmp is cheated, it is 6th february already, but 4th february is when I should have written this :-P</p>
