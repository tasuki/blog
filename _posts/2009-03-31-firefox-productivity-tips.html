  content: "Littlefox is also a good, economic theme. I've been using it for ages.\r\n\r\nYou
    didn't list ctrl-w for closing a tab :)\r\n\r\nNo need for any toolbars at all
    in my opinion. At least when you're like me, and visit only 2-3 sites regularly.\r\n\r\nDownload
    statusbar is not needed anymore. Sine a few versions ago, you can set the option
    that the download windows doesn't appear (instead you get a progress meter in
    the statusbar... exactly like.. the download statusbar plugin).\r\n\r\nSomething
    which I cannot live without are keywords for sites. Just type a shory keyword
    in the location bar, and the site opens. Keywords for seach engines are pure win
    as well -- the fastest way to search in specific engines.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if opera
    would have a decent adblocker it would eat firefox for breakfast :-P Just try
    browsing an internet forum with images which are wider than your screen, and then
    do it in opera."

    bloated...\r\n\r\n-- \r\nFirefox is a registered trademark of Mozilla Corporation."

  content: What's missing in the Opera adblocker is the possibility of turning it
    on for some sites, and off for others. Sometimes you want to support some sites
    by having their ads downloaded on your hd.

<p>If you are like me, you spend a lot of time using firefox. Chances are that you don't use it as effectively as I do. :)</p>
<p>Let's start with the look. First, use a minimalistic theme. I use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6971">full flat</a>, but <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/364">whiteheart</a> is also kind of cool. Such themes simply don't get in your way, which is exactly what you need.</p>
<p>You probably use several toolbars which take way too much of your screen space. Right-click on a toolbar and select "customize". Then you can drag everything around and hide the unused toolbars. I currently have three rows of toolbars:</p>
<ul>
<li>First toolbar has File, Edit, View menu and others, back, forward, reload, cancel, home icons, location bar, and finally a search bar.</li>
<li>Second toolbar contains quick bookmarks - just the pictures without any text, so that I can fit in as many as possible.</li>
<li>Third toolbar is shared google toolbar (used mostly just for PageRank), webdeveloper toolbar, user agent switcher and adblock settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>I often see people wasting their screen space by using the default configuration with menus in the first toolbar and action icons and location bar in the second one.</p>
<p>Speed up firefox by installing fasterfox or simply google around a bit to find out (enable pipelining, disable ipv6, etc.).</p>
<p>Learn to use keyboard shortcuts:</p>
<ul>
<li>ctrl+T -- open new tab</li>
<li>ctrl+L -- go to location bar</li>
<li>ctrl+K -- go to search box</li>
<li>ctrl+up/down -- switch search engines when in search box (don't forget to order them in a way that suits you)</li>
<li>alt+enter -- open the search from search box in a new tab</li>
<li>ctrl+shift+T -- open an accidentally closed tab (you can even repeat this shortcut -- superb!)</li>
<li>ctrl+b -- bookmarks</li>
<li>ctrl+h -- history</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use a mouse, install and learn to use mouse gestures. At least the few ones for back/forward and open/close tab. I personally prefer <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6366">FireGestures</a>, as that is the only gesture extension that actually knows what I mean when I perform the gestures. 8-)</p>
<p>Out of the helpful extensions that I use, I must mention at least <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/26">Download Statusbar</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/743">Customize Google</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865">Adblock Plus</a>.</p>
<p>And I almost thought I wouldn't make another post in March. ^^</p>
