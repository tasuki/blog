  content: "Refreshing point of looking at it, thanks for reminding me :).\r\n\r\nBtw,
    I think you actually can't say that you don't need no education as you've just
    used double negative  :P (maybe funny pun on song? :) )."

  content: "I thought someone might point out that \"educashion\" is wrong spelling.
    It's even wrong spelling of the \"official wrong spelling\", which is \"educashun\"...
    :P\r\n\r\nOk, back to the point â€“ double negative in this context underlines rebeliousness
    of the statement. I think that you can't really blame Roger Waters for that."

  content: I was going to point this out tasuki, but then I thought edu-cash-ion is
    kind of my "dancerous", and decided to leave it.... for Merlijn ;))

  content: Haha, sorry I didn't even notice educashion, it was too subtle for me to
    notice ;). After all, I am just a stupid geek pretending to be clever :P.

<p>No, not another Pink Floyd post...</p>
<p>It happened that I changed schools again. Faculty of business management at vutbr was real crap (so crap I'm not even giving them a link). Easily the worst school I've ever seen. While I think that educashion is very important, I'm not a fan of schooling. One can educate (or should that be "educash"?) oneself watching <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=type%3Agoogle+engEDU">google's educashional videos</a> (thanks to keo for <a href="http://www.keo.cz/?p=24">pointing it out</a>), reading books (some of which are even available online, like <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a>), or listening to podcasts (I'm not really into that, though).</p>
<p>Currently, I study cca 8 hours a day and I'm learning a lot. Although it consists mostly of selfstudy, if I face a hard problem that I can't solve or just get stuck, there are teachers to help me. Also, there's free water and they even pay me money for studying there. All in all, can't complain.</p>
