<p>I think I finally get it. There is <strong>no point</strong> in making sites for popular keywords (unless you make a high quality site. If you make a site similar to thousands of other you will never get <em>any</em> traffic from google (and traffic from google is what counts). You have to concentrate on niche sites (hopefully I finally understood what it means). It is better to rank first for something 100 people search for every month than to rank 1000th for something millions of people search everyday.</p>
<p>Now the exciting part - using <a href="http://inventory.overture.com/d/searchinventory/suggestion/">overture keyword selector</a>, I found a phrase that is said to be searched 100,000 times a month and using google I didn't find a <strong>single site</strong> about that topic (or about that bunch of keywords, which are often used together (no, I will not tell you :-P)). So... if I manage to rank somewhere at the top... well, I guess you can figure out the rest... :-)</p>
