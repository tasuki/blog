<p>I've wanted a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSLR">DSLR</a> for a while. At first, I wanted to buy an entry level camera like Canon 1000D, but after I found out that the price of a used Canon 20D (semiprofessional camera, about five years old model) was considerably lower than price of 1000D, I just had to buy it.</p>
<p>1000D has more megapixels, but that's about where the advantages end. 20D is more sturdy, has better handling and controls, rubberized grip, bigger viewfinder, higher frameburst rate (5 shots per second) and better high iso performance.</p>
<p>I decided to buy two lenses (neither money nor space for more :-)). The first one was the kit 18-55mm with IS (maybe buying used lenses isn't such a good idea... but hey -- it was cheap). As the second one, I originally wanted to buy Canon 50mm f/1.8, but I wanted also a little longer lens (I already have 50mm covered by the kit lens) and after finding the new <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/vivitar_85_14/">Samyang 85mm f/1.4</a> with manual focus, it was an easy decision. That said, I'm still fighting with getting the focus right (it is very very hard, as almost everything appears in focus in the viewfinder... I wish I had live view and could zoom in to get preview of focus).</p>
<p>I am really happy with the high iso performance. With Canon 20D at ISO 3200, the noise is somewhere between ISO 200 and 400 on my point & shoot Canon A590. Five shots per second is very useful whenever you are shooting something moving unpredictably (kittens!).</p>
<p>I hope I haven't become an equipment-theoretician freak yet. :)</p>
