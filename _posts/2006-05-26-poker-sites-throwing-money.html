  content: "I'm listening :). You're right. Overall, people come to play. It would
    be nice to win it, but the players could care less.\r\n\r\nHowever, $100k reward
    is just short term promotion. Lowering their rates would be a long term thing,
    which isn't very profitable."

<p>I am seriously pissed off. I just read over at pokerstars blog about their <a  href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/2006/05/marajade-pokerstars-5-billionth-hand.html">5 billionth hand</a>. They have thrown $100,000 (one hundred thousand dollars) away. Yup, they gave it to the 5 billionth raked hand participants.</p>
<p>Sure, poker sites get a lot of money from rake, and this is a way to say thanks or rather to give back a small amount of what they raked. But this is just lottery, taking small amount of money from a lot of people to give a lot of money to just very few persons. If they lowered the fscking rake, players (at least the sane ones (and I believe there are many of them)) would be much happier.</p>
<p>What I meant is &nbsp; poker players are there to play poker, if they wanted to play a stupid lottery they would just go and buy a stupid lottery ticket, it's that simple. Well, I am probably unable to express myself clearly, since I am pretty angry, but if you think about it you won't need my explaining. :-P</p>
<p>PS: Blog is a veeery good thing when you need to complain and you just can't find anyone that would be willing to listen. :-)</p>
