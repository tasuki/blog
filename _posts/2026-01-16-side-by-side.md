title: Side by Side
---

Hey, a project announcement! I made [a project](https://github.com/tasuki/side-by-side), errm, thirteen years ago?

It's a Javascript thing that allows you to compare different translations side-by-side. I tried to make it [easy for others to set up](https://github.com/tasuki/sbs). I used this to create comparisons of [Enchiridion translations](https://enchiridion.tasuki.org/) and [Tao Te Ching translations](https://ttc.tasuki.org/). On [my corner of the internet](https://tasuki.org/), these two are the most viewed pages.

Anyway, the idea was that it'd be easy for others to set up their own comparisons of whatever they wanted to compare. I'm happy to report that many people have attempted to use this, and some have succeeded. In no particular order:

- [Tao Te Ching in Russian and Ukrainian](https://pa-ta.github.io/tao-sbs/) ([163 commits](https://github.com/pa-ta/tao-sbs)): Hey this guy figured out how to use the switch between the groups: for the Russian and the Ukrainian language. Deserves a medal!
- [Οδύσσεια](https://levyatsishin.github.io/Odessey-sbs/) ([37 commits](https://github.com/levYatsishin/Odessey-sbs)): Russian and Greek, the two languages I don't know. Amazingly, this one contains an audio!
- [Lucretius: On The Nature Of Things](https://cassiusamicus.github.io/sbs/) ([96 commits](https://github.com/cassiusamicus/sbs)): Good if you're like learning latin or something.
- [Lucretius](https://epicureanfriends.github.io/sbslucretius/) ([22 commits](https://github.com/Epicureanfriends/sbslucretius)): These good people forked my thing, then ripped out my code and wrote it all themselves. Comprehensive!
- [Diogenes Laërtius Ten](https://epicureanfriends.github.io/dlx/)([13 commits](https://github.com/Epicureanfriends/sbslucretius)): Same people, similar fork.
- [Meditations](https://davs3275.github.io/sbs/) ([43 commits](https://github.com/davs3275/sbs)): I read the Hays translation once.
- [Meditations Book 2](https://wassname.com/sbs/content/meditations-book-2/) ([only 9 commits](https://github.com/wassname/side-by-side)): Translations by George Long, Gregory Hays, and Robin Waterfield. Also contains three new (21st century) [translations of Enchiridion](https://wassname.com/sbs/content/enchiridion/) and [the litigious Red Pine translation of Tao Te Ching](https://wassname.com/sbs/content/tao/). I gotta read these through!
- [The Letter Box](https://shreevatsa.net/bazin-letter-box/) and [an accompanying blog post praising me](https://shreevatsa.net/post/bazin-letter-box/) 😉
