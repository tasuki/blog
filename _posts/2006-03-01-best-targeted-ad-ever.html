<p>I checked one of my sites today and found a wonderfully targeted ad. The page is about <a  href="http://herewego.tasuki.org/dmx-hwg/">DMX's song Here We Go</a>, the lyrics is full of "fuck", "nigga" and is very agressive. Putting "Anger management" ads there is really appropriate, but I highly doubt any of DMX's fans will appreciate that ;-)</p>
