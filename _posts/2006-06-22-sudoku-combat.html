<p>I used to think that sudoku was stupid. But lately I've seen someone solving it and was explained why there is much more to it than I'd originally thought.</p>
<p>And recentlky I found <a href="http://www.sudokucombat.com/">Sudoku Combat</a>. It rocks. :-) The best thing is ability to easily challenge your friends with whom you can compete in real time. Just challenge me! (errr, I mean... when I get back from Warsaw, which will be in 4 days or so (yeah, I know, my poor blog isn't recieving much attention from me...)).</p>
