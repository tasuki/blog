    Chocolate...\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n(psst, does it work?)\r\n\r\n\r\n(ps. Damn! I still
    have to reply to you in the post about IQ and shit.. I'll do it tomorrow from
    uni, promise)"

  content: "Well, these were just examples, I am also trying to do things that fulfill
    me (such as playing go (also, I'm going to meet Takemiya-sensei (and rainy-chan)
    this weekend, yay!)).\r\n\r\nAnd I think the important thing is to base your happiness
    on stuff that can't be taken away from you (yes, maybe in the future there will
    be no more chocolate and hot water won't be available, or whatever, but I think
    in that case I'll be way too busy trying to survive to care about those things,
    anyway).\r\n\r\nAs for the dark chocolate inducing happiness, I think it works...
    and it's also healthy for one's heart and reduces blood pressure :)"

    zápisem z mého blogu (i když to byla jen špička mého ledovce štěstí ;-)

<p>A year ago I predicted that 2007 would be better than 2006, and indeed -- it was.</p>
<p>And I have plenty of reasons to believe that 2008 is gonna be even better. :-)</p>
<p>Today I went skiing, and it was grrreat. The slope was not steep at all, but carving skiing makes it plenty of fun even without steep slope. And without poles (pun fully intended  :P) it's even better.</p>
<p>Also, I think I've become <a  href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1424079446171087119">happy</a>. At least during the past few months I've been feeling happier than ever (it's not as intense as sometimes, but instead it's a very, very persistent happiness). And I don't think it happened by chance. I concentrate on my happiness a lot. For example, I eat about 1/3 of an extremely dark chocolate ("Wawel" chocolate, 90% cocoa, made by Poles (see, Poles can be useful, after all ;-))) during each workday. Also, I'm going to take a really hot shower right now, and then I'm gonna get close to 8 hours of sleep (gosh, I'm almost envious... ^^).</p>
<p>Happy new year!</p>
