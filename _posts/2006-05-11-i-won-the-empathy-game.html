<p>I came in first in <a  href="http://asociace.hzik.com/datum.php?date=2006_05_10">yesterday's empathy game</a> (czech only, sorry). That's quite a good result considering that my empathy level is pretty low and that I only spent a minute or so thinking about the words (but maybe it's actually better this way).</p>
<p><a  href="http://hzik.com">Operanda</a> made this <a  href="http://asociace.hzik.com/">empathy game</a> inspired by littlegolem's empathy game, with the only practical difference that this one is in czech.<br />
Well, it's a cheap link just for letting me win, isn't it? ;-)</p>
