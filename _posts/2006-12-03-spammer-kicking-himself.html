<p>I noticed that there are people coming to my homepage by <a  href="http://www.google.com/search?q=loretta+swit+nude">searching for loretta swit nude</a>. It surprised me, because there's nothing on my homepage about loretta swit (I never even heard that name before). After looking into my guestbook, I noticed that it got heavily spammed. Well, that's sad, but the nice thing is that the spammed page ranks much higher than the spammer (actually there are more spammed pages in the search results around mine). Also, the spammer didn't manage to make links work, so there are just his keywords, and I'm ranking higher than him, which is rather funny...</p>
