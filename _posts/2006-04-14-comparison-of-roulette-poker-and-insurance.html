    na jeden zápas. Pravda ale je, že většina lidí vsází na víc.

  content: "No, myslim, že tě studium ekonomie bude bavit... Dělej do pojišťovnictví
    tam použiješ stejné znalosti psychologie a statistiky jako v pokru...\r\n\r\nObecně
    platí: malé riziko -&gt; malý zisk (a naopak) a stejně tak malá likvidita -&gt;
    velký zisk - to je jenom pro případ, že by ses příště vrhl na kapitálové trhy...
    (Tam se dá taky fakt hodně a docela rychle získat, akorát je to o hodně náročnější...)"

<p>There are many various types of betting, most of them have one thing in common - you bet a rather small amount of money and there is a very small chance that you will win <strong>a lot</strong> of money. Why are there no lottery tickets for $1 where you would have 50% chance for winning $1.90? Or 80% chance for winning $1.10? I guess people just wouldn't buy them. But why do people buy tickets for $1 where they have 1 in a million chance for winning $100 000? I can not think of any other reason than that they are stupid.</p>
<p>Comparison:<br />
Insurance - you pay just little money and if something highly unprobable happens you can get a lot of money<br />
Lottery - you pay just little money and if something highly unprobable happens you can get a lot of money<br />
Roulette - you choose how much you want to risk, but you will lose on average 1/37 of what you bet<br />
Poker - depends mainly on your knowledge of statistics and psychology compared to your opponents', you choose how much you want to risk<br />
Betting with friends - has the best positive expectation if you have the right friends and know how to do it, reminds me of a former classmate who lost every single bet he has made (he thought he'd write a 500 page book, run faster than marathon winners, and so on...)<br />
<strong>Post edit: </strong>Stowawaying is another type - you have a very high percentage to win a very small amount and a very small percentage to lose quite a huge amount.<br />
As a side note, I face the same problem over and over when writing to the blog - I have a lot of very good ideas (at least I think so), but I am too lazy to put them in proper order (I just write what I think of, the order is more or less random) and generally play with it a bit, I just write it all down and publish it. Otoh this has the advantage that it forces you to find out the connections yourself, so maybe that would be a good excuse for my laziness. :-)</p>
