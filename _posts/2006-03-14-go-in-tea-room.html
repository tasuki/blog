<p>I've just returned from six hours long go playing session. It was in a tea-room called "Chajovna" (in Brno, Dominikánské náměstí 6/7) and I really liked it. I haven't been going to Brno go club lately (for several years :-)), but I think I will now start going to Chajovna more often (I'd even dare to say regularly, but that seems a bit too binding ;-)).</p>
<p>Most of go playing people there are beginners, but there seem to be a few single kyuish people and hopefully my presence will also bring in some more serious players. :-D</p>
<p>Anyway, the atmosphere alone was enough to make it a very nice experience.</p>
