<p>Yesterday was my birthday. Many people wished me happy birthday. It is nice that they remembered (or their icq told them) and I appreciate it. But I never really cared about birthday, it never was anything special for me (except those birthday when I got my driver's licence and could legally start drinking alcohol, that was kinda special).</p>
<p>On this birthday I wished just one person to remember me. She didn't. I am not really sure why, but it really put me down. Maybe it is because from my point of view we experienced quite a lot together. And I am not sure I want to know her point of view.<br />
Whatever.</p>
<p>Post edit: The second paragraph is now obsolete. :)  Better late than never...</p>
