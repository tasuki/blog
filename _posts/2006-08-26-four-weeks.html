    have cheered harder in the second week. Sorry. Was the tournament worth going
    after all?\n\nPS. How does it feel to have _and_ a headache _and_ to find
    100+ games waiting for you?:)"

  content: "The first week was totally excellent and in the second one I really had
    tough opponents. The only loss I could be unsatisfied with is the one against
    Bernd Radmacher (and now that I checked the stats he has better GoR than me),
    but I played miserably and he played really good so I can't really complain :-)\n\nConcerning
    the monster tournament… I didn't even get to accepting the game offers yet…

<p>Yeah, I've been away for four weeks… o_O</p>
<p>I spent the first two weeks in Rome playing <a  href="http://www.figg.it/rome2006/">EGC2006</a>. I almost missed my plane due to the train being late, but a taxi saved me. In the main tournament I was doing really well during the first week, my only loss was against Dragos Bajenaru (and it was because of coming late to the game because someone told us to change the train, which wasn't a good idea, finally we had to take a taxi and arrived about two minutes too late… not saying that I'd win otherwise, just pointing it out  ;-)). Our team called "Lordi" (Antti Tormanen, me, Antti Holappa and Ilkka Mattila) managed to get second place in team tournament, which gained me a really nice thing which is difficult for me to describe (it consists of metal and blue glass and is quite heavy). The second week was not so succesful, I only won one game out of five. I have a lame excuse that my opponents were strong, but I think I could have done better.</p>
<p>After returning I spent one week cycling and canoeing in south czechia and the other week at czech go camp near Polička.</p>
<p>Today I woke up with headache and fever.  :cursing:</p>
