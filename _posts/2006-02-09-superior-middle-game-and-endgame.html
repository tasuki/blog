<p>...or you could say inferior beginning :)</p>
<p>I usually start very bad in board games, be it go, TwixT or amazons (in hex, chess and dots&boxes I don't know at all, so it is probably even worse ;-)), but later on I often surprisingly catch up. I recently managed to win so many games I considered lost that it really surprised me (I even seem to have a good chance of getting second place in <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=twixt.ch.11.2.2">second TwixT league</a> of 11th TwixT championship (which would mean returning to the first league)).</p>
<p>I seem to have similar problems in beginning stages of <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(board_game)">go</a> and <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_of_the_Amazons">amazons</a> (prolly as the games are surprisingly similar), I take sure points, but too few of them. Maybe it has to do with my mind and general approach to things - I prefer to take less and to have it sure than to take more and risk, I hate risking. But my cowardish approach pays off in the middle game and even more so in the endgame.</p>
<p>Someone once told me that I play much better go when I play for influence, well, I usually only do that in handicap games, since there I seem to be so much behind from the beginning that it calls for something weird. I hope to try it on a tournament soon, since I have virtually nothing to lose now (I have fallen about as low as possible after that Polish tournament (oooh, didn't tell you about that? ...and I <strong>will not</strong> tell you :-P)).</p>
<p>This post evolved kind of chaotically while doing several other things, so please forgive me if there are many errors and too few ideas. I am also pretty tired... and tomorrow - cross country skiing - yay. Good night.</p>
