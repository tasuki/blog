<p>There are many SEO contests running at the time. SEO contest consists of someone announcing the keywords, search engine(s) (usually google) and deadline. Whoever ranks first (or sometimes in top five or so) for search for those keywords in that search engine after the given period of time usually gets some $$$.</p>
<p>Probably the first famous one was <em>nigritude ultramarine</em>, which was announced and "played" during 2004.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 2006 more SEO contests popped up - <em>carcasherdotcom seocontest</em>, that seems to offer quite a lot of money and <em>v7ndotcom elursrebmem</em>, that is full of controversy but definitely more popular.</p>
<p>Time for some links I think... Jim Westergren's <a  href="http://www.jimwestergren.com/v7ndotcom-elursrebmem/">v7ndotcom elursrebmem</a> entry is full of informations about the contest, so if you want to know more, I suggest you to visit his site. Then I feel moral need to support my friend who's got almost no links although his <a  href="http://v7ndotcom-elursrebmem.hzik.com/">v7ndotcom elursrebmem</a> entry is rather original.</p>
<p>And now to the main point of my post - what is the reason for all those contests? There are thousands of dollars in stake so no wonder participants are well motivated, but I am still not really sure about the organizers... some demand a backlink (which helps them popularize their site quite a lot, as they get valuable links from highly optimised sites made by SEO experts) and some do not.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a great opportunity to learn how search engines work (as those words weren't used before and everyone had the same starting position), and it seems that strong links and interesting, often updated content are very important (nothing revolutionary, huh? ;-)).</p>
