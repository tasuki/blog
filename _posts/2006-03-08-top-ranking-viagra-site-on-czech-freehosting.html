<p>When you <a  href="http://www.google.com/search?q=viagra">search for viagra on google</a>, 8th and 9th result (out of about 50 millions, out of which many are highly targetted) is one site on a czech freehosting - home.tiscali.cz.</p>
<p>The site has PageRank zero, only has a few hundreds of <strong>very</strong> lame blog spam links, not a single genuine link from an authority site.</p>
<p>Leaves one wondering... how the fsck can google be so dumb? (and also: why my Ã¼ber-1337 spamming techniques aren't as effective as these crappy ones? ;-))</p>
