<p>Luo Xihe has beaten virtually all the top Korean players (Song Taekon, Lee Sedol, Choi Cheolhan and Lee Changho) to win 10th Samsung cup. I am not very happy with him winning as I am a fan of Lee Changho, also see this picture:</p>

<p>Luo Xihe is on the right, dressed, errr, not really well, raising his hand to play while Lee Changho is still putting his stone, doesn't seem very good manners to me...</p>
