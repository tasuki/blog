<p>There are two IRC channels about SEO I have found so far - #webmasterradio at irc.webmasterradio.fm and #SEO on EFnet. The second one is more crowded and less chatty and the first one is full of SEO experts (chatting mostly about nonsense though ;-)).</p>
<p>I guess I am going to hang around there for a bit, cause I like irc more than various web forums.</p>
