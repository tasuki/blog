  content: To znám. Nedávno mě docela bolelo pravý zápěstí od myši. Chvíli jsem ovládal
    myš na střídačku levou a pravou, cca po hodině. Docela to pomohlo, ale nakonec
    se jako nejlepší ukázalo používat myš co nejmíň. Při psaní na klávesnici problém
    nemám.

Today it returned, after more than half a year without problems. I noticed several symptoms and it freaked me like hell.
</p>
<p>
For those of you who do not know, <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">RSI</a> is Repetitive Strain Injury, it is usually caused by sitting by the comp 15 hours a day ;-).
</p>
<p>
I first learnt about it a year ago or so, and in the beginning of the summer I noticed that I have several of symptoms (mostly uneasy feeling in fingers, but sometimes also in arms). Luckily we went to Corsica then and all got okay. Then I almost forgot and only remembered today. My mistake (apart from sitting by the comp all the time) was that I didn’t keep my fingers warm which is not good for ankles. Well, some hot water and ten minutes rest and all seems okay, but I am still freaked and I am afraid to take mouse in my hand (as that is much worse than keyboard because it fixes the hand in single position).
</p>
<p>
Well, my point: when you feel tired from the computer, have a rest at least for a while. It helps to have breaks regularly (but not once in five hours as I do ;-)). Well, enough of writing, that only makes it worse. :-)
