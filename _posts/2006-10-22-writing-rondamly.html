  content: I find it really interesting. Have you tried to decrypt what you've written
    in that half-sleep status? Of course, I do a lot of mistakes in typing, typically
    I switch the neighbouring letters, But that's caused by lack of coordination in
    my fingers.  Btw. I like your site.

  content: "It's hard enough to try to decrypt what I write when I'm awoke, trying
    to read something I've written asleep is impossible. :licknose:\r\n\r\nBut well,
    it usually lasted only for 5-10 characters (then I either woke up or fell asleep
    completely)."

<p>While my spelling is generally good (it was always easier for me to remember how words are written than how they are pronounced) I always had troubles distinguishing vowels. I mean, I usually do know which vowel there should be, but I just sometimes make the mistake of writing a different one instead. I always realize it immediately when I see the word on screen, but somehow I don't realize it when writing. So yeah, recently I've written 'rondamly' instead of 'randomly' in a chat and they thought it was a good joke… well, it actually wasn't...</p>
<p>Sometimes I write a whole word differently, like writing 'hojo' instead of 'toho' (happened to me the other day). I don't know the cause, and it's not particularly annoying, it's just strange and surprising.</p>
<p>I vaguely remember experiencing something a bit similar in some high school classes – I was very tired and trying to write what the teacher was saying, and as I was falling asleep, my hand somehow continued writing, although it didn't write letters anymore, just random something that looked a bit like letters (and of course it had nothing to do what the teacher was saying as I was asleep by that time).</p>
<p>So it might actually be the same… you are still writing because of momentum while your brain already has a holiday...</p>
<p>Has anything similar ever happened to you?</p>
