  content: I am a player in the monster....it is a tremendous load.  The guy who suggested
    the monster is certainly no idiot, he is a top competitor and is very very smart
    and will likely make it to the finals.  Idiots do not play thinking games.  Idiots
    can not play thinking games and instead make ridiculous blog posts, such as  the
    thread started by "masochistic"

    didn't want to offend anyone.

<p>There are 20 different board games on littlegolem. Some idiot thought it would be a neat idea to make a tournament involving all the games for the title "Monster of Little Golem". He gathered with other similarly thinking retards in the forum and we (did I really say "we"?) decided to play in four groups of 7 people, each pair playing each game twice (with each player moving first in one of the two games). This makes a grand total of 20 (games) * 2 (each game played twice) * 6 (opponents) = 240 games. And you know what? The "reward" for being succesful (in first two of the group in number of won games) is ticket to the grand final, 8 people who will each have to play 280 extra games (I decided to spare you the math now).</p>
