<p>Hello from Edgy Eft!<br />
Recently I got a new disk and I decided it might be a good idea to make a clean new install (I had the previous system through warty - hoary - breezy - dapper). I didn't want to upgrade the old system to something which is still unstable and I thought it might also be good to get rid of all the trash that I don't use anyway... (well, yeah, I copied my whole home directory with a lot of trash, but at least I got rid of the programs that I don't use).</p>
<p>And the first time experience? Magnificent! I encountered no serious problems, almost everything "just worked" out of the box and the things that didn't were pretty easy to fix.</p>
<p>List of "nice and surprising":</p>
<ul>
<li>sounds: the default intro sound of gnome  was so horrible it was almost unlistenable, the new one just rocks, gaim also has different sounds, it will take a while to get used to it but they are better I think (and now gaim also has a volume control, w00t)</li>
<li>new artwork: nothing spectacular, a bit better than dapper (which was pretty good, at least compared to previous "shit brown" themes)</li>
<li>firefox: 2.0beta is just better (it has one small mistake that when I search by / it doesn't let me highlight the words, which sucks, but maybe I can set it somewhere...)</li>
<li>gaim 2.0beta... it simply rulez (hey, why is everything 2.0beta?)</li>
<li>a lot of things stayed the same and 95% of my ~/.something configuration files work so I don't have to reconfigure everything.</li>
<li>many problems that I <em>expected</em> didn't occur at all... wifi (which was borken in the 2.6.15 kernel), nvidia, wine (particularly fonts), X server, java, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that was a clean install, I will see what an upgrade looks like when they release the official version and I will upgrade my sister's system, but after such a pleasant experience I don't expect any problems either.</p>
