<p>I have nothing to write about so I will just make some blatant self-promotion:</p>
<p>Need a webdesign, web programming or search engine optimization? Or maybe you know about someone who needs it? Then there is nothing better and easier than visiting my <a  href="http://widehead.tasuki.org">webdesign page</a>.</p>
<p>If you are curious to know why it is called "wide head", well, it's a parody for "white hat", and once I thought it was kinda funny... (and hopefully I can hit the top of google for "widehead" quite soon even without trying - not so sure whether it will help though ;-)).</p>
