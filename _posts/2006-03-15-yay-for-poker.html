  content: "Ha, you've discovered poker! \r\n\r\nFor me (a poor littlegolem-go player)
    go is just like poker...  I feel the same excitement when I plan an invasion or
    preparing a kill, having no idea wether it will or even can succeed and when I'm
    waiting for a final spade for a high flush after the flop:)"

<p>I've been playing a lot of (usually board) games, but never played poker before. I thought it was just a very random game where winning/losing is decided primarily by luck. Now I do not think so anymore. Poker is definitely a game of skill if you consider long time earnings.<br />
I tried to play online for so called "play money" which has no value whatsoever, and, hummm, I actually enjoyed it. :-)</p>
<p>Then I talked with several (actually two ;-)) professional poker players (big thanks to "Ch." who doesn't want to be mentioned :-P) who told me a lot of interesting things about poker and poker strategy (please note that I am real beginner, learned the rules like five days ago; but hey - so far I've been rather good in all games not involving too much luck and physical agility, so I guess I should give poker a try as well).</p>
