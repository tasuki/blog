  content: "Apparently the imagined importance of making money depends on a few things.\r\n\r\nGenetics:
    Guy making lots of money is good, so he can show off around the girls and make
    them happy with expensive things and show how important she is to him by spending
    time and money on her instead of making even more money. Other than money in a
    guy, women don't often care much about it.\r\n\r\nEducation: Through education
    one can overcome the above mentioned evolutionary trait to do something more worthwhile
    with one's live than solely making babies.\r\n\r\nSocial: Social pressure is not
    to be underestimated. Some people are just happier if they are high up in the
    show-off chain.\r\n\r\nDoes this comment thingy give me a message btw if there's
    a reply to my post?"

    what you want, but it's closest to it)."

<p>You often hear people complaining about how much money someone else makes. They talk about politicians or football players or anyone else who makes a lot of money (actually, politicians don't really get that much money). They are envious and want to have that much money too.</p>
<p>But when was the last time you heard anyone complaining about those buddhist monks who achieved happiness? Surprisingly, most people are not envious of them. I'm not really sure why that is so, but I think that it's because people don't really want to be happy. They want to have a big house, luxurious car, and many other things, but they don't actually care about happiness.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2008/happiness.png" alt="happiness vs money" align="right"/>Don't get me wrong here, money is very important for one's happiness. People who completely lack money are likely to become unhappy as a result. Complete lack of money makes it difficult to get food, place to sleep at and other important things like that. But as long as you have enough money to survive comfortably (ie. not permanently stressed about where you are going to sleep tomorrow and what you are going to eat), getting more money is not going to increase your happiness nearly as much as you might think it would.</p>
<p>I think the key to <em>real</em> happiness lies in consciously and fully enjoying small joys of everyday life. I won't suggest anything particular, as each of us has to find their own, different small joys.</p>
