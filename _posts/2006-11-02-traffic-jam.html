<p>Next time you get stuck in a traffic jam, please realize that it <a  href="http://picasaweb.google.com/dolboeb/MosGorProbka">could have been much worse</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know that this is what most of blogs look like: "hey look I found a link", but I promise you are going to get a full post tomorrow (no promises about its quality though).</p>
