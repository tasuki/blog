<blockquote><strong>Aerosmith: Dream on</strong></p>
<p>Every time that I look in the mirror,<br />
All these lines on my face getting clearer.<br />
The past is gone,<br />
It went by like dusk to dawn.<br />
Isn't that the way?<br />
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay.</p>
<p>I know nobody knows,<br />
Where it comes and where it goes.<br />
I know it's everybody's sin,<br />
You got to lose to know how to win.</p>
<p>Half my life's in books' written pages,<br />
Live and learn from fools and from sages.<br />
You know it's true,<br />
All the things come back to you.</p>
<p>Sing with me, sing for the years,<br />
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears.<br />
Sing with me, if it's just for today,<br />
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away.</p></blockquote>
<p>A very good song, I can play it over and over and never get bored. The lyrics is also enlightening, sometimes you can learn more from fools than from sages and you definitely got to lose to know how to win, which applies not only to go or other games, but to life in general.</p>
<p>Dream on, dream on, dream until your dream comes true...</p>
