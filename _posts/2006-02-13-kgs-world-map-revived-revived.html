<p>Well, almost...</p>
<p>So now I have it up & running, good ol' <a  href="http://kgs-map.tasuki.org/">KGS World Map</a> now hosted by tasuki. :)</p>
<p>But, there is a serious problem with database encoding - I was not able to recognize it. So here is request for help, with some additional info:</p>
<p>Å (A with circle, as in Århus) is dec 313 (or hex 0139)</p>
<p>à (a with reversed accent) is dec 341 (hex 0155)</p>
<p>è (e with reversed accent) is dec 269 (hex 010d)</p>
<p>And it is even a bit trickier than just that as some characters are escaped, for example ů is written as &amp;#367;</p>
<p>Well, that's about it, whoever helps me gets a beer :)</p>
<p>PS: I wonder whether WordPress screwes the special characters I wrote here...</p>
