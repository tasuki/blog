<p>Fear not – this post is not gonna be in German.</p>
<p>I left work early on Friday and headed for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Agency_%28Brno%29">Student Agency</a> bus. The movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpse_Bride">Corpse Bride</a> was pretty good and before I knew it, I was in Vienna, just few hundred meters from the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prater">Prater</a>. Buying a "Stadtplan" was an ordeal, but I finally managed after about half an hour, and the old lady who sold me the map even spoke English.</p>
<p>After nearly two hours of walking (an hour of which was the historical center, where I visited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Stephen's_Cathedral,_Vienna">Stephansdom</a> (St. Stephen's Cathedral) and really enjoyed the whole Rotenturmstrasse (it pwns <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graben%2C_Vienna">Graben</a>, too) I arrived at <a href="http://www.wombats-hostels.com/">Wombat's hostel</a> (the "The Lounge" one). I was really impressed. It's all rather new in there, <em>all</em> their staff is fluent in English, and one night is just for 17€. An all-you-can-eat breakfast (with various meats, rolls, breads, juice, yoghurt, cheese, …) for only 3.5€ (I'd bought a smallish square of cheese + 4 rolls for 5€ in the supermarket that afternoon). Oh and in case you forget your towel (like I did), you can buy Wombat towel for 6€. There's also free wifi access, and for those of us without a laptop, internet-connected computers are available for 1€ for 40 minutes.</p>
<p>The next day I arrived at the go club (<a href="http://www.go7.at/">GO7</a>, arguably the best go club in Europe: huge playing room with many nice table boards with slate&shell stones, floor board, every English go book about 5-10 times, portraits and pictures and many pro players' signatures hanging on the walls, kitchen, two extra rooms just in case, a wonderful 3-dimensional 7*7*7 board (crap, I didn't finish my game against Lothar), and perfectly located on <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariahilfer_Stra%C3%9Fe">Mariahilfer strasse</a> (warning: only Deutsch and Norsk versions available atm, someone plz make an English version)) just in time.</p>
<p>After we played one round of a tournament, Takemiya sensei arrived, together with Kenmochi Jo sensei and Kobayashi Chizu sensei. Takemiya sensei commented some of the games, we got problems to solve, and we all generally had a lot of fun. In the evening, mister Kitani, the son of Kitani Minoru, sang a nice English/Japanese song for us. I was very surprised by his advanced English, which was nearly without an accent.</p>
<p>Sunday was more or less similar, but definitely no less fun than Saturday. Too bad I missed the wine drinking in the evening because I had to leave. Also, rumour has it that people were getting fans signed by the professional players on Tuesday. Hell, I'd cut my arm (the left one) off for a fan signed by Takemiya sensei, Kenmochi sensei and Kobayashi sensei.</p>
<p>My journey home was again cheaply, nicely and safely provided by Student Agency.</p>
<p>PS: I got two small presents in Vienna but I didn't give any. Does it mean that: a) I really rock so people bring me presents; b) I am an asshole because I don't bring others presents even though they do.</p>
