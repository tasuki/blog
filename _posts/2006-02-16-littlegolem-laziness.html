<p>I used to have 240 hours on littlegolem for all my games all the time (they use <a  href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?FischerTiming%2FDiscussion">fischer time</a> there). That is not true anymore, now I try not to get under 50 hours (well, not really succesful). This is very bad attitude, I just press "skip" all the time being too lazy to think about what to play...</p>
<p>On a more positive note I will finish second in <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=twixt.ch.11.2.2">twixt.ch.11.2.2</a>, which means advancing to 12.1.1 - first league again... w00t...</p>
<p>Now that I look at it I've already played first twixt league five times - that's quite a lot, also noticed that I've played twixt for almost two years... gosh, I am getting old. :-(</p>
<p>It also seems I will win <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=go9.ch.12.2.2">go9.ch.12.2.2</a>, but considering the competition, that is not much of a success...</p>
<p>Anyways, I'd better go and think about some of my games as the time is ticking...</p>
