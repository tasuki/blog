I always thought Marilyn Manson was just an idiot. Shouting obscenities, trying to offend everyone in any possible way, etc. Then I saw few videos on youtube:<br />
<a  href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Welsq8vZM">Marilyn Manson Bowling for Columbine</a><br />
<a  href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucnA8ElvZQA">Marilyn Manson on O’Reilly</a><br />
<a  href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh0WGhf2s3U">Marilyn Manson speech</a>
</p>

While I am not going to start listening to his music (I just don’t like it), I started greatly respecting the guy. He is very smart and extremely articulate.
