  content: Musím takhle zpětně tu tvoji Flickriver ocenit -- byl to asi hlavní zdroj
    obrázků, které jsem si za nekřesťasnské peníze za tisk vyvěsil po pokoji.

<p>When I saw the link to "badge creator" (marked as <em>new</em>) on flickriver, I knew I just had to add that to my blog. But somehow the side column was too long already...</p>
<p>Making the whole thing wider, adding the second side column and adding my flickriver favourites was the first change (the most work on this one was to change the header picture).</p>
<p>The second change was setting the main text to left-align instead of justify. I spent a great deal of time thinking about whether I should do it, but I really couldn't decide. So I just decided to use the common <a href="http://webtypography.net/Rhythm_and_Proportion/Horizontal_Motion/2.1.3/">advice of the experts</a> (that site seriously rocks, they even hang left quotation signs, and follow just about every other rule which is normally almost unfollowable on the web).</p>
<p>The third change was the most difficult and tedious. I won't say what it is, but I'll give you few hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>it has something to do with the bits of extra empty space that appeared almost everywhere</li>
<li>it was especially necessary because of the extra column</li>
<li>it has a very positive effect on the visitor, although 98% won't even realise it</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you guess what the third change is?</p>
