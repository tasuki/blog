  content: "The best short stories I know are stories written by Borges. There is
    no   clear difference between reality and fiction, it is smart and surprising...\r\n\r\nI
    love for example \"Babylonská knihovna \" and \"kruhové zříceniny\"\r\n\r\n(sorry,
    don't know the english name)"

<p>Short stories are good when you don't have much time but want to read something (why welcome, Captain Obvious).</p>
<p>Here are few that I really liked:<br />
<a href="http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html">Isaac Asimov: The Last Question</a><br />
<a href="http://www.terrybisson.com/meat.html">Terry Bisson: They're Made out of Meat</a><br />
<a href="http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/MoxoMast.shtml">Ambrose Bierce: Moxon's Master</a><br />
<a href="http://poestories.com/text.php?file=pit">Edgar Allan Poe: The Pit and the Pendulum</a></p>
<p>I strongly advise you to read at least the first two.</p>
<p>Somehow, I wasn't that impressed by other short stories such as Nightfall (it wasn't that bad, but somehow I expected the generally accepted best short story to be better, it was also longer than needed—the shorter the better) or An Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge.</p>
<p>And finally, I would like to ask for <em>your</em> advice. Do you know any really good (and possibly short) short stories?</p>
