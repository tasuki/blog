You probably don’t want to use a <tt><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/mutable/ListMap.html">ListMap</a></tt>. It has an interface of a <tt>Map</tt>, but is “powered” (that’s too good a word) by a <tt>List</tt>. Thus pretty much any <tt>Map</tt> operations you call on it will take ages. Consider using a <tt><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/mutable/LinkedHashMap.html">LinkedHashMap</a></tt> instead – it will preserve both the element order and your sanity.

That’s me trying to blog more.
