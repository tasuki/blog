<p>Do I spend too much time at work?</p>
<p>Let's see:</p>
<p>First, I work eight hours a day and I sleep eight hours. That means I work <em>half</em> of my waking time.</p>
<p>Second, I only work <em>two out of three</em> days (counting weekends, public vacations and paid holidays adds up pretty close to one third). This means that I spend one third of my waking time at work. Not too bad.</p>
<p>Third, I'll probably work around <em>half of my life</em> (I didn't work during my first 20 years here and I won't work when I'm old either).</p>
<p>That means I am going to spend about <strong>one sixth of my life at work</strong> (awake life, that is). That definitely doesn't feel like "too much", does it?</p>
<p>Oh, plus I got some tesuji up my sleeve... but more on that next time. 8-)</p>
