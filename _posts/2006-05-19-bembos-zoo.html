<p><img align="right" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/pastonchi-f.png" />I like the good old dynamic serif typefaces (from 15th-17th century). The most well known is <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamond">Garamond</a>, which is also my favourite one, together with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=pastonchi">Pastonchi</a> (which is so unknown it doesn't even have its wikipedia page, although it's a very sexy typeface (I especially love opennes of the small letter 'f' (see the pic on the right side), and letter 'k' is rather cute), so the link points to google). Then there's <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bembo">Bembo</a>, which isn't quite as great as Garamond (let alone Pastonchi), but it's still a fair one.</p>
<p>Someone thought it would be a funny idea to make <a  href="http://www.bemboszoo.com/">animals of the Bembo letters</a>, and so they did. It's a stragne idea, but I quite like it. The only problem is that it's waaay too fast. Show me the word and then let me watch it for at least five seconds (no, half a second is not enough, really).</p>
<p>Humm, yet another confused post. The headline says Bembo, then I get all excited about Pastonchi (and even include a picture (which has nothing to do with the headline, btw)) and then finish with Bembo again. Well, whatever, I'm not gonna rewrite it anyway...</p>
