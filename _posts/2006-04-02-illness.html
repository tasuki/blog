<p>Yeah, I am ill.</p>
<p>It's a reason why I haven't been to Pilsen tournament and it's also a (pretty lame) excuse for ignoring my blog. But, it's slowly getting better and I was able to get some work done, more specifically, <a  href="http://tasuki.tasuki.org/?page=tex">Almanac of Czech Go Championship 2005</a> (hum, this link isn't actually the link to the document but you will find it on that page pretty quickly I guess).</p>
<p>Good night, I am gonna sleep so that I get healthy and can go to Berlin pair-go tournament next weekend. :-)</p>
