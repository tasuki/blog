<p>Another second place on a go tournament in a short time frame, though this one wasn't such a succes as I was theoretically strongest there (according to the <a  href="http://gemma.ujf.cas.cz/~cieply/GO/gor.html">Go rating</a>). But in fact I was rather lucky in some of my games.</p>
<p>The tournament was very nice, with a small and very cheap bar just at the playing place and many pubs near. One could even watch films in the evening or drink vodka with people from Poland :-)</p>
<p>Kudos to Janek for winning the tournament without a single loss and to Tomik for finally getting 1d.</p>
