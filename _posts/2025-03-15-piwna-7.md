title: Piwna 7

I spent eight wonderful years living in Warsaw, at Piwna 7. It was the greatest place to live:

- nice surroundings, the [beautiful tiny old town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town,_Warsaw)
- restaurants abound, personal faves:
  - *Ciao Napoli*, Wąski Dunaj: superb Neapolitan pizza
  - *Vege Miasto*, Solidarności: vegan stuff that tastes amazing
  - *Maharani*, Freta: Indian
  - *San Antonio*, Ogród Saski: unfortunately perma-closed
- art galleries everywhere
- [plac Zamkowy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Square,_Warsaw) with an endless supply of amazing street musicians
- in Summer, [Jazz na starówce](https://www.jazznastarowce.pl/), an annual jazz festival
- in Winter, "Lodowisko na rynku starego miasta", free-entrance ice rink
- [Ogród Krasińskich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasi%C5%84ski_Garden) and [Ogród Saski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxon_Garden) walking distance
- wonderful and interesting neighbours
- friends randomly dropping by whenever they happened to be nearby, which was often

It is one thing to see all these things as a tourist and to be immersed for years. During the 2020 pandemic it felt like I had the whole old town for myself.

Over the years, the Piwna 7 downstairs commercial area was occupied by:

1. Cukrowa Sowa, very expensive sugar, they had nice logo and were friendly and harmless.
2. A jewelery store with an atrocious logo, didn't last long.
3. The worst Żabka in the whole wide world.

[Piwna street has its own wikipedia page (in Polish)](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulica_Piwna_w_Warszawie). And the Piwna 7 house has [its history written on warszawska.info](http://www.warszawska.info/stare-miasto/piwna/piwna7.html) and an [item on WikiData (with a pic!)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q33549113).

You can see some of my [2016 pictures from Warsaw](https://gallery.tasuki.org/2016/01-warsaw), and [2020 pandemic pictures from Warsaw](https://gallery.tasuki.org/2020/warszawa).

As of early 2025, the apartment I lived in for eight years is for rent on [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1044628272222316488), [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/VacationRentalReview-g274856-d29006221), and [Booking](https://www.booking.com/hotel/pl/one-bedroom-apartment-next-to-the-royal-castle-in-warsaw-by-renters.html). Seeing how these types of services care about their urls, the links will probably be dead before anyone clicks.
