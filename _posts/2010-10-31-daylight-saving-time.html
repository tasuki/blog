<p>The European one. It's wrong.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="CEST" src="/assets/2010/dst.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Central European Summer Time starts on last Sunday of March and ends on last Sunday of October. I never paid much attention to it, but always assumed that the start and end of daylight saving time is somehow related to equinox.</p>
<p>Now I found out the longest night of the year happens two months after switching to winter time and three months before switching back to summer time. <strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>To correct the assymetry, I demand for <abbr title="Central European Summer Time">CEST</abbr> to start one month earlier, on last Sunday of February. I'd been planning to visit Brussels anyway.</p>
