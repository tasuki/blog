<p>After having read the rules these were my <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=brkthr.ch.2.4.6">first games of breakthrough</a>. I fully understand that winning fourth league isn't much of an accomplishment, but I am happy nevertheless. I really enjoy breakthrough, the <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/games/gamedetail.jsp?gtid=brkthr&page=rules">rules are very simple</a> yet the strategy seems quite complicated.</p>
<p>Looking forward to playing more breakthrough...  :hearteyes:</p>
