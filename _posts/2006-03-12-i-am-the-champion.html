<p>Huh, well, yeah, I am czech student champion.</p>
<p>I won all six games, but most were against kyu players, so it doesn't really count...</p>
<p>I was rather lucky in game against Písa (1dan), where he managed to perfectly destroy my moyo/influence, then I beat Hezi (5dan, 2nd strongest czech player) in a crazy game where I played for influence and he played for territory (usually it is the other way around). Another game worth mentioning was against Bróňa (1kyu) whom I've beaten by 4 or 5 points after crushing him in the endgame (so I must had been losing before).</p>
<p>For the first place I won 500CZK (cca 18€) - w00t. (yeah, it barely paid travel expenses...)</p>
