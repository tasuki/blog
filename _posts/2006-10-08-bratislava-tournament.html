<p>Now you might think that I'm just slacking off, but actually it is not so...</p>
<p>I spent a busy week in Bratislava, playing two go tournaments.</p>
<p>The first tournament was European Team Go Championship, where the Czech team placed second, just behind the ultrastrong Romanians. Third place was taken by Hungarians, who were about same strength as us, but we got lucky and won against them. Other teams weren't really even competing about placing in top three...</p>
<p>The weekend tournament was quite big (more than 100 players), my results are not so great, but I somehow got the best 4dan prize, which was definitely a neat surprise.</p>
<p>Concerning my games... it was just strange â€“ I won many games that I should have lost and I failed to win some games that I should have won, but I guess that in the end it's more or less fair anyway. :-)</p>
<p>As a side note, I won 500svk (~13eur) in the casino (did I mention that the tournament is played in beautiful Reduta Casino and that each participant gets a 100svk chip. You can't cash it, you have to play it, of course. So I put it on 1/6 to win (you have to use more valuable chips for betting on more probable things like 1/3 and 1/2), exactly 31-36... and... voila... 31 fell. So I took the money and cashed it out. But they were looking a bit strangely at me cashing out this ridiculous amount of money...  :P</p>
