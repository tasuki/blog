<p>I have read some <a  href="http://www.ashidakim.com/zenkoans/zenindex.html">Zen koans</a> lately and I came to realise that what most people tell me is not necessarily correct. I heard way too many times recently that I just have to forget. That is not the way to go, apart from being impossible it also seems wrong to me. The right way is to put up with what happened, to reconcile with the situation as it is.</p>
<p>Close to enlightenment, ain't I? ;-)</p>
