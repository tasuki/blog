<p>
I write with my <strong>right</strong> hand.
</p>
<p>
I sleep on my <strong>left</strong> side.
</p>
<p>
I hold spoon in my <strong>right</strong> hand.
</p>
<p>
When I walk in a circle I always turn to the <strong>left</strong>.
</p>
<p>
When I walk next to someone, I prefer walking on the right side because I want to have the person on my <strong>left</strong> side.
</p>
<p>
When I walk alone, I prefer to walk so that there is something on my <strong>left</strong>.
</p>
<p>
When I listen to just one earphone, I put it in my <strong>left</strong> ear.
</p>
<p>
I chop wood with my <strong>right</strong> hand on the nearer the axe head.
</p>
<p>
I saw with my <strong>right</strong> hand.
</p>
<p>
I play floorball with my <strong>left</strong> hand near the blade.
</p>
<p>
When using a knife, I hold it in my <strong>right</strong> hand.
</p>
<p>
I hold mouse in my <strong>right</strong> hand.
</p>
<p>
When writing on a keyboard I use my <strong>left</strong> hand for about 65% of keypresses.
</p>
<p>
When swimming crawl, I always breathe on the <strong>left</strong> side.
</p>
<p>
When putting leg over leg, the <span style="font-weight: bold">left</span> one is on top.
</p>
<p>
When putting my hands as if to pray and bending the fingers (is there one word for this?), I always end up with my <strong>left</strong> thumb on the top. Doing it the other way requires a lot of concentration and then it feels very unnatural and alien.
</p>
<p>
When crossing hands, the <strong>right</strong> one is on top.<br />
When using a telescope, I look with my <strong>right</strong> eye.
</p>
<p>
I hold the shower head in my <strong>left</strong> hand and use the <strong>right</strong> hand to handle the soap or shampoo.
</p>
<p>
I hold the phone in my <strong>left</strong> hand (this might be so that I can write something down using my <strong>right</strong> hand when calling, but I hold the phone in my left hand even in the middle of the woods with nothing to write on).
</p>
<p>
Am I weird to even think about this? Is it strange that I use right hand for actually doing most of the stuff but the left side somehow feels more special (leg over leg, earphone, walking next to someone)?
