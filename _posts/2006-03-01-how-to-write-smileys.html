<p>This sucks, I spent more than an hour trying to set up a poll in WordPress and I didn't manage. I ended with some extra useless plugins and hand editing mysql entries (duh). Well, whatever, you will have to do without a poll (although that would get you bunch of lazy bums to interact ;-)).</p>
<p>There are many ways to write smileys: some people do not write closing parenthesis after smiley (as it is the smiley itself and the closing parenthesis might seem as if it was more smiling smiley) and some do.</p>
<p>Some people write punctation before smileys, some write it after smileys and some do not write the punctation near smileys at all (as it seems as a birth mark of the smiley).</p>
<p>The only thing I do not like is people writing smileys without space before them, sticked to the word in front of them. That drives me mad.</p>
<p>Humm, not very complete post, but I am already tired of trying to set up the poll... However, I am <strong>very</strong> interested in <em>your</em> opinions, so <em><strong>please</strong></em> write them here.</p>
