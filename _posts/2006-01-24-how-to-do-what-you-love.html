<p>I just read <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">how to do what you love</a> by Paul Graham. The guy is a genius, really. But I bet that you are too lazy to read it through because it is oh so very long. You will just scroll through it and miss most of his points. Well, too bad for you...</p>
<p>And in case I now motivated you to <strong>really</strong> read it and you liked it, you might also like Paul's <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">other essays</a>, especially the one about <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html">procrastination</a>.</p>
