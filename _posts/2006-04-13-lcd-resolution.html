<p>A lot of people have LCD displays (the flat ones, as opposed to CRT monitors). The "problem" with LCD is that each pixel (the little dot that can display any colour) is physically fixed in one position. So using LCD with different resolution than the one it was built for is a very bad idea. But still, some people do it. They apparently don't mind that all the image is blurred as the poor LCD tries to display something that should be just between its fixed built pixels.</p>
<p>What surprises me even more is how some people clearly do not get it. I tell them, I even change the resolution for them to see how much better it is, but next time I come it is back to before. I got told various reasons for this - the image is too sharp (huh?!?), the fonts are too small (what about using bigger ones?), the application elements are too small (you have to put up with this, but it will actually save you space on the display for more important things).</p>
<p>I will not give up my fight against using LCD with wrong resolution, but I strongly consider carying a gun with me as it seems the only possible way to explain this to some people. ;-)</p>
