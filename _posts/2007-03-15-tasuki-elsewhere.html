<p>Maybe you noticed the new cathegory in the sidebar - "tasuki elsewhere".</p>
<p>It's not like I publish anything on youtube or deviantart, but I do use the "favorite" feature.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://tasukisempai.deviantart.com/favourites/">deviantart favourites</a> contain a lot of pictures of nature (often landscapes), many nude chicks and some great vector art by celsojunior. All in all, if you have at least two minutes, have a look at it!</p>
<p>On youuutube, I have organized my <a  href="http://www.youtube.com/profile_favorites?user=tasukisempai">favourites</a> into <a  href="http://www.youtube.com/profile_play_list?user=tasukisempai">playlists</a>. These are in facts not playlists but just categories. Some of the videos are utterly hilarious, so if you have like, errrm, 5 hours, make sure you watch them all! ;-)</p>
<p>As a side note, I'm at my sister's computer now (but running my X programs through ssh) because my LCD is being repaired, and I have to say that this is for sure <em>the w</em><em>orst</em> keyboard I have ever used.</p>
