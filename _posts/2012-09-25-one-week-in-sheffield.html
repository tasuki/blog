<ul>
<li>Almost got run over dozen of times. Surprisingly, on a bike it's easier to keep left.</li>
<li>Stores are open (convenient; I've lived in a country where stores are closed).</li>
<li>In Sainsbury's, everything is either discounted or 3 for the price of 2. You think people would see right through that, but I still get excited when whatever I want to buy turns out to be discounted.</li>
<li>Show me a white person in Sheffield and I'll show you two Asians.</li>
<li>Local "pale ale" is actually very tasty.</li>
<li>Female cashiers twice your age call you "my love".</li>
<li>Yesterday at a concert I met a guy from South England who couldn't understand the Sheffield accent either.</li>
<li>Cheddar.</li>
<li>Hot girls are usually Asian. Or Spanish exchange students.</li>
<li>Full English breakfast is not bad. Though the beans take time getting used to.</li>
<li>Sheffield is hilly. Even though five speeds are all I need on my bike, sometimes I can't help but secretly wish for a lower speed.</li>
<li>Ordered spicy pork noodle soup in an Asian place. It was the spicy-in, spicy-out kind.</li>
<li>There's no light in my hotel bathroom but the pub downstairs is way cool.</li>
<li>Museums and galleries are plentiful and free.</li>
<li>Had to pack and move all my things three times in one week. Bought a pull-up bar and a bicycle to make the process more challenging.</li>
<li>Got called up on stage at a local theater play. Scared me so much that when asked where I was from, answered Argentina.</li>
<li>Peak district is awesome.</li>
</ul>
