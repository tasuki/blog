    was off, what do you expect when someone asks a question like this out of the
    blue in a vacation setting? (For how I came up with 1/40: I remembered 1/7 being
    the lowest figure in that list so I multiplied by 1/6 for one rank less for about
    1/40. Well &lt;2.5% is almost zero no?) I apologize if you were insulted, that
    obviously wasn't my intention, but if you really cared I guess you'd just have
    told me privately instead of publicly posting something about it.\r\n\r\nI sent

    job for a paparazzi newspaper, cause A) your figures are off: 1 in 14 means I'd
    have to win *13* vs. you 1 to break even, so you'd get 13 points not 14,\r\nand
    B) you seem to be very adept at painting one-sided populist but completely nonsensical
    pictures on random info that's a month old.\r\n\r\nAwaiting your reply"

  content: "<em>Ok, so it seems my estimate was off, what do you expect when someone

    you were confident enough to <i>say</i> 1 in 40 but you are not confident enough
    to put some <i>money</i> down on 1 in 14. I think that already says a lot.\r\n\r\n<em>I
    sent you an invitation on DGS. If you want to put money on it make me a real offer
    cause I’m obviously not going to care about something I said while being half-drunk
    and without any good data.</em>\r\n\r\nFunny, you didn't need a game to estimate
    1 in 40, now 1 in 14 is way too much and you need a game to estimate where around
    1 in 7 it should be?\r\n\r\nThis is the real offer, 65% discount. Obviously you
    do not care about it now, but obviously you didn't care about not having any good
    data back then. You could have said \"I don't know, let's play a game so that
    I can see\", but you didn't need that back then. By the way, I not surprised that
    the estimate was way overestimated instead of underestimated.\r\n\r\n<em>your
    figures are off</em>\r\n\r\nMy bad... sorry, I didn't intend to trick you.\r\n\r\n<em>you
    seem to be very adept at painting one-sided populist but completely nonsensical
    pictures on random info that’s a month old</em>\r\n\r\nWhat the hell? It is \"a
    month old\", yeah, because I have to work and I'm a busy person. But how is it
    one-sided? How is it populistic? And how is it \"completely nonsensical\"?\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    I think you should get your next (first :-P) job as a manager because you are
    good at saying something completely stupid and then fighting your way out of it."

    for any unintentional harm, why do you keep using it as a valid argument? Without
    it your whole reasoning runs on nothing:\r\nAny bijective operator applied to
    a random number is still random; Similar that you do math tricks on bad data doesn't
    mean the data gets any better. \r\n\r\nI'm just wondering now with what intention
    you posted all this. \r\n\r\n- If you were joking, then everyone had a laugh already
    so let's drop it.\r\n- If you wanted an apology, you had one in my previous post.\r\n-If
    all you wanted was to confirm your idea that I'm arrogant, there's probably nothing
    I can do to make you think otherwise. Makes me think of Fuytablees... (Any idea
    incidentally why everyone stopped playing?)\r\nMaybe you can ask some other people
    what they think about me or just tell me next time you think I'm going too far.
    It's more useful than writing blog posts.\r\n- If you're serious about playing
    an n-bango you could just have asked me normally. If you want to put money on
    it for whatever reason, try approaching it from my perspective cause even if with
    fair odds there's nothing in it for me.\r\n\r\nTake care"

<p>When asked by someone about my chance of beating you in go, you said it's "basically zero". And as if that wasn't insulting enough, when asked about the exact number, you said "probably 1 in 40" (for the curious reader -- no, this is not Lee Changho we're talking about, he's not even a professional).</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether it was before or after, but the same person who asked you also asked me the same question, and I said 1 in 5. After rethinking it, I admit it might have been a bit on the optimistic side (not nearly as much as you though), but I'm not going to change it for following calculations.</p>
<p>Now that we have some numbers, we can find a fair middle value... x/5 = 40/x gives us x=14.142135624, so each of us is getting 2.828427125 times better deal than they wanted. And because I like you, I'll make it 14. Sounds fair, doesn't it?</p>
<p>You choose the time settings (I'm open to various possibilities, thought I probably wouldn't like any of the extremes).<br />
You choose the size of bets (when you win, you get 1, when I win, I get 14 -- that's fixed). Again, I'm open to various proposals, but it shouldn't be ridiculously low (at least 2€ per unit) and it shouldn't be ridiculously high (my budget for this experiment shouldn't exceed 2k€).<br />
I'd like to play at least a dozen games (possibly many more, basically as many as you want, as long as I'm within my budget :))</p>
<p>Also, I can assure you that since then, I haven't studied go for more than 2 hours a week and I do not plan on increasing that.</p>
<p>There are several ways out for you (sorted by lameness):</p>
<ul>
<li>pretending you haven't read this post (lameness factor 100%)</li>
<li>saying you were joking (come on, there were people around and everyone saw you were being serious, lameness 95%)</li>
<li>trying to bargain a better course (look, I'm not a businessman and I'm not going to bargain, if you win just one third of what you claim you can win, you'll be fine; lameness 90%)</li>
<li>coming up with an excuse (lameness ranging from 80% to 110% depending on the excuse)
<ul>
<li>not enough money (first, you are going to win big, so this is not an issue, second, if by some chance you lost, I can wait and you pay with inflation corrected interest)</li>
<li>not enough time (come on, as we all know, you are <em>too smart to be able to get a job</em>, so you have plenty of free time)</li>
<li>any other lame excuse</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>admitting that you were wrong <em>AND that you are an arrogant asshole</em> ;) (lameness factor 50%)</li>
<li><strong>accepting the challenge (lameness factor 0%)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With love, always yours,<br />
