The sound of police sirens.

If it's an ambulance or firefighters, that's cool. But with police or politicians, it always annoys me. Who are you, so important you have to disturb my and other peoples' peace?

Well, I watched [King Charles' first audience](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-62854289) with the prime minister[^audience] and there it was: the sound of sirens. And who are you, so important you have to disturb both the king and the prime minister?

[^audience]: I just wanted to see how old he looked and how he was holding up. This was the first video that popped up.
