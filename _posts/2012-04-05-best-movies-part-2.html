<p>In my <a href="http://blog.tasuki.org/best-movies-of/">previous blag post</a>, I've written about Ingmar Bergman and Krzysztof Kieślowski, my two favorite film directors. If you like their movies, you might like the following ones as well.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001789/">Андрей Тарковский (Andrei Tarkovsky)</a></h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079944/">Stalker</a></strong> - One of my best film-watching experiences ever. It was so different from what I had expected of a sci-fi movie. The sound was breathtaking. I was literally at the edge of my seat the whole time. The movie was inspired by the <a href="http://lib.ru/STRUGACKIE/engl_picnic.txt">Roadside Picnic</a> novel by Strugatsky brothers, which is also seriously cool.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060107/">Andrei Rublev</a></strong> - based on life of an icon painter, the movie depicts life in medieval Russia. The movie was a tad too slow for me, but I did enjoy the bell-maker side story.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000975/">Robert Bresson</a></h3>
<p>Robert Bresson had a peculiar habit of starring non-actors in his movies and discouraging them from acting. The lack of acting, in a way, makes his movies resemble books.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049902/">A Man Escaped</a></strong> - Is about a French guy escaping from a Nazi prison. During the movie, the main hero mostly spends his time trying to disassemble his cell door with a spoon. Who would have guessed such a movie can be enjoyable?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053168/">Pickpocket</a></strong> - As opposed to A Man Escaped, I couldn't really associate myself with the protagonist. If I find myself unable to find a job, I'll watch this again for educational purposes. Cinematically, it was good though.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042619/">Diary of a Country Priest</a></strong> - Loved how the characters evolved in this film, though the priest himself was a bit of an enigma. I wonder whether Bresson was a christian or not. As a non-believer in the three-in-one god, I still greatly enjoyed this film.</p>
<p>Next in my watchlist: more Ingmar Bergman.</p>
