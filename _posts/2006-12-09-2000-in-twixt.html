  content: "[…] My game against passenger, who will probably finish third, didn&#8217;t
    look very promising for me, as I mentioned in a previous post. It was after my
    move 11, his move 12 was a surprising and devastating mistake. Playing I13 instead,
    forcing my I12, would lead to a winning game for him. Of course, after J5, I13
    no longer needs to be answered locally. Omitting this exchange practically gains
    white a very important move for connecting the right side string to the lower
    area. Fast forward to 22, that&#8217;s a pretty much forced exchange. I am not
    sure if my 23 is good, but I felt it would be enough. 24 should imho be played
    at K18 (kosumi, for those of you who know go  ). After that I can&#8217;t play
    H17 (because of L16), so I&#8217;m forced to follow I16, I19, E18 (I&#8217;ll
    leave the subsequent variations to the kind reader  ). After 24 it&#8217;s quite
    easy already, but overall I was pretty lucky that passenger missed 12.i13. […]"

W00t!

I have <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/info/player_chart.jsp?gtid=twixt&plid=5460">finally reached rating 2000 in TwixT</a>, my second favorite game. Although I used to be in top ten with rating around 1950, I am not in top ten (12th currently) with 2000 now… the times are a-changin’…

On a less positive note, I am currently playing <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/tournament/tournament.jsp?trnid=twixt.ch.13.2.1">twixt.ch.13.2.1</a> (13th championship, second league), and I need to finish second. Which basically means beating passenger, with whom the game is <a  href="http://www.littlegolem.net/jsp/game/game.jsp?gid=605441&nmove=11">not looking really well after 11 moves</a>.
