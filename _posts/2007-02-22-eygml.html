<p>EYGML stands for European Youth Go Masters League. I've been creating (official) <a  href="http://eygml.tasuki.org/">EYGML 2007</a> pages. I have learned a lot of new things, and I have refreshed some that I knew already...</p>
<p>I've...</p>
<ul>
<li>...discovered some xhtml/css tricks (like using double divs right inside each other to avoid weird margin adding).</li>
<li>...learned to work with GIMP (using layers religiously) when creating logos and favicons.</li>
<li>...finally learned to use (My)SQL.</li>
<li>...wrote almost a thousand lines of php, including:</li>
<ul>
<li>highly automated registration, logging in/logging out, possibility of changing personal info</li>
<li>choosing a random quote from a file formatted as a standard 'fortune' file</li>
<li>showing nearest three birthdays (actually you can call the function with a paramater like 500 to learn that Lacour will be 31 years old on 10.10.2016 (poor guy))</li>
<li>automatic info updating from the official EGF database</li>
<li>sgf uploading and parsing of the result</li>
<li>(members only) voting for a logo</li>
<li>and last but not least: GD - it completely rocks, now you can see GD generated graph on the logo voting page, and if I ever get a possibility to create something else with GD, I will :-)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The pages are a bit of a mess, but when I'm done with all the features (I still need to create the league playing system, for example), I will try to make the interface more comfortable for users.</p>
