EYGML stands for European Youth Go Masters League. I’ve been creating (official) <a  href="http://eygml.tasuki.org/">EYGML 2007</a> pages. I have learned a lot of new things, and I have refreshed some that I knew already…
</p>
<p>
I’ve…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
…discovered some xhtml/css tricks (like using double divs right inside each other to avoid weird margin adding).
</li>
<li>
…learned to work with GIMP (using layers religiously) when creating logos and favicons.
</li>
<li>
…finally learned to use (My)SQL.
</li>
<li>
…wrote almost a thousand lines of php, including:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
highly automated registration, logging in/logging out, possibility of changing personal info
</li>
<li>
choosing a random quote from a file formatted as a standard ‘fortune’ file
</li>
<li>
showing nearest three birthdays (actually you can call the function with a paramater like 500 to learn that Lacour will be 31 years old on 10.10.2016 (poor guy))
</li>
<li>
automatic info updating from the official EGF database
</li>
<li>
sgf uploading and parsing of the result
</li>
<li>
(members only) voting for a logo
</li>
<li>
and last but not least: GD – it completely rocks, now you can see GD generated graph on the logo voting page, and if I ever get a possibility to create something else with GD, I will :-)
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
The pages are a bit of a mess, but when I’m done with all the features (I still need to create the league playing system, for example), I will try to make the interface more comfortable for users.
