<p>I've played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVONN">DVONN</a> (which is a game from the <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIPF_project">GIPF</a> project) once in Prague's board games club called Paluba. Now I started to play DVONN on littlegolem (no link needed for regular readers, right? :-)) and I found myself in trouble after noticing that I play it despite not even remembering the rules exactly.</p>
<p>Well, now I am trying to fill the gap, and I found out one interesting thing - my brain probably consists of a neural network because I was able to mimic my opponents' strategy even without knowing the rules... Now you might think that I spend my time talking about banalities, but have you thought about it <strong>thoroughly</strong>? I mean, I have no idea how neural networks really work although I've been trying to understand it, I have no idea how <em>my own</em> fscking brain works.<br />
On a more positive note, my and your (however dumb ;-)) brain is still a wonderful thing capable of solving very difficult tasks. Congratulations!</p>
<p><small>I guess I'd better go to sleep already... (by the way... why is this post called DVONN?)</small></p>
