<p>I had to solve another issue at <a  href="http://kgs.kiseido.com">KGS</a> today. Someone was swearing in hebrew (using word <a  href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=benzona">benzona</a>) and one user pointed me to <a  href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/">Urban dictionary</a>. Well, I searched around a bit (of course) and the one I liked the most is the word <a  href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fuck">fuck</a>. The best description is probably the second one - from Monty Python (anyone knows where from exactly?), so go and vote for it so that it gets to the first place (community driven websites just rock (please remember this, in a few posts I will remind you))</p>
