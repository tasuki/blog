<p>I haven't made a blog post in quite a while, that's because I was in Berlin and didn't have much time.</p>
<p>There was a <a  href="http://www.govb.de/govbweb/epgc06/index.html">pair-go championship</a> (two pairs playing against each other, partners alternate in making moves). We finished fifth with Anicka, which is quite nice considering we haven't played pair-go together yet. Apart from that, it was a nice trip, I saw Berlin (I expected a bit more but I don't complain), ate some sushi and various different japanese-style food.</p>
<p>I also met In-seong Hwang, who studied go (or baduk, as they use to call it in Korean) for five years at Korean <a  href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?MyongjiUniversity">Myongji university</a>. There is a department of baduk at college of arts, it must be totally incredible to study go at university (instead of informatics, for example :-)).</p>
