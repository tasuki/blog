<p><a  href="http://www.emptytriangle.com/">Empty Triangle</a> is a great go comics by chidori.</p>
<p>My personal favorites are number 4 (I love it), 6 (how very true), 7 (touching), 8 (love the facial expression), 10 (hey, it's actually me), 14 (the art in there is just great).</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, Empty Triangle beats all the other go comics (and I've seen them all, some of them (such as <a  href="http://almostsente.art.pl/">Almost Sente</a>) are actually pretty good).</p>
<p>By the way, I've been to Visegrad tournament (no link to the results, not worth it :S) and master chidori herself drew a great picture on my fan. I am very grateful to her. :)</p>
