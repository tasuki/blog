<p>Reading comics is a very pleasent way of wasting one's time, therefore, I'd suggest you a few time-wasters that I really enjoy:</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.nerd-boy.net/">Nerd boy</a> is a very geek ascii-art comics created by Joaquim Gandara. It has about 600 strips and is currently stalling. I suggest you to read the strips in order, as they don't make much sense otherwise (you can also view <a  href="http://www.nerd-boy.net/nerdboypak.php">all nerd-boy comics on one page</a> (warning: it is rather big, about 1mb)). Also, it would probably be a good idea to use "courier" (new) for viewing it, nerd-boy looks kinda weird using my favorite fixed-width font "terminus".</p>
<p><a  href="http://questionablecontent.net/">Questionable content</a> is a comics I stumbled upon just recently. The creator has some seriously interesting ideas, good points and the comics is quite funny. You can also see the art getting better and better all the time, I find it kind of funny to watch.</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.garfield.com/comics/comics_todays.html">Garfield</a> is the comics of choice when you don't want to think too much. I think everyone knows Garfield and there's not much to say about it. Maybe just... if you don't enjoy all the flash shit^H^H^H^H ads and stuff, you can use my excellent bash scripts that will <a  href="http://www.tasuki.org/garfield.zip">download all the Garfield comic strips</a> for you and create html pages for more comfortable viewing. The script puts all 365 strips from one year to one html page, while you might think it's weird and it takes too long to load etc, I assure you that scrolling is way more faster than clicking "next" or something. I always prefer to have real long pages and not to have to click at all, just scroll. Scrolling heaven.</p>
