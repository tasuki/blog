I’ve been undergoing torture all my life. These devices of the devil bend my body 90° at the waist, and then <em>again</em> 90° at the knees. Halfway between bent and straight. I can hardly imagine anything less comfortable.

I’d be happy if the chair-angles were either bigger or smaller. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneeling_chair">Kneeling chairs</a> are nice, as the body/thighs angle is about 110°, which “reduces lower back strain by promoting proper spinal alignment”. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zafu">Zafu</a> is cool, because you can sit on it in many different ways, according to your current mood. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_bag_chair">Bean bags</a> are comfortable, they adjust their shape to your shape. Sitting on the floor leaning against a wall with legs stretched out and a small pillow under your back is almost as good as sitting on a bed of leaves leaning against an oak.

But Aeron? No thank you.
