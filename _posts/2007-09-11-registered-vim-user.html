<p>I am now officially a <a  href="http://www.vim.org/account/profile.php?user_id=13049">registered vim user</a>.</p>
<p>There are several reasons:</p>
<p>I greatly admire Bram Moolenaar, the creator of <a  href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> and founder of <a  href="http://iccf-holland.org/">ICCF Holland</a>. Bram sends all the vim registration fees to Uganda to help local children.</p>
<p>I can now vote on vim feature requests.</p>
<p>And last but not least â€“ I had some money stuck in paypal (it is stuck basically because paypal is stupid). If you need to pay something by paypal, you can send me the money by bank transfer (or simply give it to me) and I'll pay it for you. :-)</p>
