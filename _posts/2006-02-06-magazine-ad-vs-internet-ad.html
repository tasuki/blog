<p>I saw a magazine where you could purchase a one page ad for about 1300€, edition being 4000 pieces. That makes <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_Cost_Per_Mille">eCPM</a> about 300€, which is almost <strong>hundred times more</strong> than usual eCPM on internet pages.<br />
Of course, printing the magazine costs some money, but it is not that much to make it this expensive, I really do not understand the reasons for such a big difference. Any ideas?</p>
