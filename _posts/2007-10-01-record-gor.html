  content: Many players in CZE gets stuck at 4d level. There is a theory that once
    you are 4d, you are finally strong enough to understand how difficult it would
    be to reach 6d and this awakening is so desperate that they abandon the effort.
    Is it your case?

  content: "I guess that's at least partially true. :)\r\n\r\nAnd in my case, any
    further improvement would have taken too much effort to be worth it (at least
    for now)â€¦ so, yeah, you're right."

<p>While I didn't have any spectacular results recently, my results were stable and I reached my all time high <a  href="http://gemma.ujf.cas.cz/~cieply/GO/gor.html">GoR</a> of 2454 (I came close to 2450 several times but never actually reached it).</p>
<p>What a pity I don't live in Poland, I could already boast (undeserved) 5d rank. ;-)</p>
<p>To sum up my go career so far, I reached 2d after two years, then 3d in under a year and then 4d in a year and a half. I've been stuck there for almost 3 years now and I don't see it changing anytime soon (partly because I just don't want to sacrifice my life to go). <em>Sigh.</em></p>
