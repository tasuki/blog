  content: "do you know a song by jon lenon called imagine\r\n\r\nimagine there is
    no haven \r\nno hell below us\r\nimagine all the pepole living for today\r\n\r\n\r\nyoure
    idea is fun but to me its sad\r\nok then you are just what you are\r\nnothing
    more\r\nthe world is just the world and nothing more\r\n\r\nthen there is no meaning
    ?\r\nno reson to live?\r\nno reson to keep on going?\r\nbecuse it will all just
    end in a void\r\nyou will just stop to be\r\n\r\nyou know a few years ago i was
    thiking about the same thing\r\nthe meaning of life is the search for meaning\r\n\r\ni
    realy dont like the idea of an end\r\nwe humens create riligan becuse we belive
    that man has some thing\r\nmore\r\na consciousness\r\nso when you think about
    you not existing you think about simply\r\nyoure consciousness in an empty world\r\nand
    that idea is just wrong from its core\r\nif you dont exist there is no void\r\nthere
    is nothing youre mind can understand or talk about at all\r\none if the basic
    ideas of beliving in some thing is that you belive in some thing you cant understand\r\nand
    cant ever realise truly\r\n\r\nsaying that after life is over there is nothing
    and all is meaningless\r\nis just like saying there is an afterlife you cant understand\r\n\r\ni
    prefere looking in life and phisics and saying look at all the meaning i see before
    me\r\nhow i am just a part of every thing else and every thing is just a part
    of me"

  content: "Yes, I know that song...\r\n\r\nLife will just end once, but why does
    that have to mean that there is no reason to live? I think that the fact that
    life will end once is precisely the reason to try, because I only have one chance
    to live through my life.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't think the meaning of life is the search
    for meaning, the meaning of life is living (yes, it is kind of recursive, but
    recursion is fun).\r\n\r\nWhen I think about me not existing, I do not think about
    my consciousness in an empty world. My consciousness will cease to exist, I will
    have nor negative nor positive feelings. Just very simple void. It makes me feel
    strangely calm."

    with that too much at the moment.\r\n\r\nI am skipping the rest of your post,
    because what you say just makes no sense. Whenever I manage to decode what you
    are writing, I discover that you suppose things that are false, and to top it
    off, you make completely wrong implications from them.\r\n\r\nBtw, if this is
    some kind of april fools joke, I'm gonna totally kick your ass."

    is a journey and in it you find many things and many ideas\r\nbut this is not

    it is the joy of everyday life, the joy of simple seemingly unimportant things.
    Maybe you should see the movie <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A9lie\"

  content: "I'm not squabbling about the definitions of words. The point is that it
    makes no sense to ask about the meaning of a thing such as life.\r\n\r\nThe term
    \"meaning\" refers to a <i>use</i>, <i>purpose</i>, or <i>intention</i> of something.
    This means that it only applies to things which are designed by someone (because
    only then there is a intention or purpose  behind it). Life is not such a thing,
    therefore asking about the \"meaning\" of it is nonsense. It's like asking about
    the \"meaning\" of a triangle.\r\n\r\nThere is also the definition of meaning
    which applies to the \"meaning of words\". But this just refers to linguistic
    content. Scientists may talk about the \"meaning\" of their results, but by this
    they mean what their results <i>imply</i>. \"Life\" cannot \"imply\" anything
    in this sense.\r\n\r\nYou may say that by \"meaning\" you refer to what can give
    you a sense of fulfillment in life, how you should life your life, what constitutes
    a good life etc. etc. But then you have to say this, and not talk about \"meaning\".\r\n\r\nIn
    any case such a question needs to be clarified; on its own it is not clear what
    is meant by it. A philosophical dictum says that you understand a question only
    when you know what possible answers it can have."

<blockquote>It's not the end<br />
Not the kingdom come<br />
It is the journey that matters<br />
<em>-- Wanderlust by Nightwishes</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I think I know why I've been happy recently – I found the meaning of life.</p>
<p>And the funny thing is that I found the meaning of life without actually realizing I found it. The trigger to my realization was a video called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERbvKrH-GC4">Music and Life (by Alan Watts)</a> (it's short enough, I promise).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Zen ... does not confuse spirituality with thinking about God while one is peeling potatoes. Zen spirituality is just to peel the potatoes.</strong><br />
<em>Alan Watts – The Way of Zen, pt. 2, ch. 2 (1957)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I think I'm starting to like this Zen thingy.</p>
<p>As it's the journey that matters, and not the end, being an inquisitive type, I of course started thinking about the end of the journey. And I found out I'm not really scared. When I'm dead, there will simply be void. The same one there was before I was born (or, before I was conscious (btw, this post is not big enough to contain a discussion about abortion)). It's actually quite consoling... no matter how bad I fuck up, the worst there can be at the end is void.</p>
<p>The only people who have a reason to be afraid of death are followers of various religions that believe in afterlife. Also, life itself is not the ultimate fun for them, as the <em>eternal</em> afterlife is far more important. Oh well, I just couldn't do without a little trolling, could I? 8-)</p>
