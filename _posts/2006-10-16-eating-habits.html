<p>I'm changing my eating habits!</p>
<p>Throughout all my life I've eaten much more than I wanted to. What is worse - I didn't even realize it, I got used to that uneasy feeling of having full stomach and being all tired and sleepy because of this.</p>
<p>When my grandma asked me whether there's a possibility of eating at school, I truthfully answered that there's a cheap canteen for students. However, I didn't mention that I usually don't go there...</p>
<p>I'm not changing my eating habits to be more fit, look better, spare money or whatever, I am changing them because I <strong>don't like</strong> eating when I feel it's too much for me.</p>
<p>My brand new eating rule: eat when you are hungry and eat just enough not to be hungry, not less and not more.</p>
